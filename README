  * Edge-Readme.txt    - Guess what you reading?


System Requirements:
  - Pentium 400 MHz CPU or later.
  - 64MB RAM (128MB RAM recommended).
  - Hardware accelerated 3D card with OpenGL drivers.

  - Either a DOOM, DOOM II, or Final DOOM IWAD file.
    (See "Getting hold of a game data" below).

    - glibc 2.


Getting hold of game data:
    You can get hold of FreeDoom from freedoom.sourceforge.net which 
    is _free_ and has been produced by fans of the game in their
    spare time, or you can purchase "The Ultimate Doom", "Doom II" or 
    "Final Doom" (Plutonia/TNT) from id software at www.idsoftware.com. 
    The shareware data will also work with EDGE. You need to copy the
    .WAD file you want to use into your EDGE directory. The wad names 
    and what game they belong to are listed below: 

    doom1.wad    -> Shareware Doom.
    doom.wad     -> Doom/Ultimate Doom.
    doom2.wad    -> Doom II
    plutonia.wad -> Final Doom (Plutonia)
    tnt.wad      -> Final Doom (TNT)


Useful Parameters:
  * Screen size: -width [screenwidth] -height [screenheight]
  * Colour depth: -bpp [depth]  (2 for 16-bit, 4 for 32-bit)
  * Windowed mode: -windowed
  * Fullscreen mode: -fullscreen
  * Pick IWAD file: -iwad [main wad file]
  * Play PWAD file: -file [addon wad file]
  * Jump to level: -warp [mapname]  (in the form of MAP01 or E2M9 etc..) 
  * External DDFs: -ddf [dirname]  (use external DDFs in 'dirname')
  * Show EDGE version: -version
  * Disable sound: -nosound
  * Disable music: -nomusic
  * Disable warnings: -nowarn


Notable EDGE features:
  - Extrafloors (3D floors), removing the original DOOM limitation
    which didn't allow rooms over rooms.  EDGE supports real 3D
    room-over-room, bridges, and liquids.

  - DDF (Data Definition Files), allow Mod/TC/PC creators to
    completely customise monsters, attacks, weapons, pickup and
    scenery items, linetypes, sectortypes, intermissions, ETC...
    using fairly simple to understand text files.

  - RTS (Radius Trigger Scripting), provides per-level scripting
    support, allowing custom scripts to run when the player enters
    certain parts of the map, or performs certain actions, or when
    certain monsters have been killed (to name a few possibilities).

  - Hardware accelerated 3D rendering (via OpenGL).

  - Jumping, Look up/down, Flying (JetPack), Zooming.

  - Many limits and bugs from original DOOM removed.


Major changes in 1.29:
  + Drag 'n' Drop support.
  + OGG/Vorbis music playback.
  + Greatly improved BOOM compatibility.
  + Added a Sound Options menu.

  + Handle DeHackEd and BEX patches.
  + IMAGES.DDF, supporting PNG and JPEG images.
  + New startup with progress bar.
  + Software rendering was removed.


Bugs fixed in 1.29:
  + crash loading a savegame with dynamic lights when D/L disabled.
  + fixed crash when starting a level in deathmatch mode.
  + quotes (") usable in response files (for filenames with spaces).
  + fixed "jerk up/down" when player steps onto a lowering lift.

  - arch-vile no longer resurrects monsters into itself.
  - fix for teleport on MAP06 (going to wrong place).
  - berserk strength now lasts the whole level.
  - night vision wasn't affecting the sky, fixed.
  - monsters on different sides now attack each other.
  - autorun is remembered in the config file again.
  - fixed some missing mid-masked textures (Eternal MAP28).
  - revenant missiles fixed to match the original.
  - fixed 'detuning' problem with MUS music.

  * Many more... See the 1.29 ChangeLog for the complete list.


General improvements in 1.29:
  + drag and drop support.  You can pass wads, demos, scripts and
    DeHackEd patches to EDGE by dragging them onto the executable.
    Everything before the first option is considered a file to add.

  + support for OGG/Vorbis Music playing.  OGG/Vorbis is music format
    similar to MP3, but is free from patents and does not require any
    royalty fees.

  + built-in support for DeHackEd and BEX patches, using normal files
    (with .DEH or .BEX extension), and also the DEHACKED lump.  Patch
    files can be added with the -deh option (like in other ports).

  - Linux: fatal errors produce a pop-up dialog box, and EDGE can be
    run by double clicking the executable.

  - new startup which shows a progress bar.
  - ability to use 32-bit screen modes (16.7 million colours).
  - V3 and V5 GL-NODES, for very complex levels (Deus Vult MAP05).
  - detect Boom maps, and ask whether to change compatability mode.
  - support Boom's line-to-line teleports and platform toggles.
  - sky improvements, including a stretch option in Video menu.
  - missing wad files (given with -file) now produce an error.
  - intermission text screens can now be skipped.
  - can disable mouse-look in the gameplay options.
  - console now slides up/down, smaller font.

  * See the 1.29 ChangeLog for more...


New DDF/RTS features in 1.29:
  + new IMAGES.DDF file.  The corresponding wad lump is DDFIMAGE.  You
    can define any type of images in this file (textures, flats, sprites
    and screen graphics), and they will override any from the WAD file
    with the same name.  Supports PNG and JPEG formats, either as lumps
    in a WAD or as external files.  Allows the full range of colours.

  + new FONTS.DDF file.  The equivalent wad lump is DDFFONT.  This is
    for defining fonts (the set of character images for drawing text).

  - new STYLES.DDF file.  THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL !!  The idea is to
    define the background colour/image and text font/colour/scaling
    information (and sounds too) for various parts of EDGE's user
    interface.  It may undergo significant changes (without keeping
    compatibility), and it might even be scrapped!  USE AT OWN RISK.

  + new RTS menu system.  A script can show a menu, which pauses the
    game until the user selects an option.  The script can then see
    what the user selected and perform some specific actions.

  + weapon clip handling has been greatly improved (and made sane).

  + support for manual reloading (new key in Keyboard Options), and
    also next-weapon and previous-weapon keys.

  + Eight new ammo types: AMMO9, AMMO10 ... upto AMMO16.

  - There are new weapon specials, and they can be given to the primary
    and secondary attack separately (e.g. SEC_SPECIAL command).  They
    include: ANIMATED, NO_SWITCH, NO_TRIGGER, FRESH, NO_MANUAL and
    NO_PARTIAL.  Many of these control reloading behaviour.

  - Numerous new weapon states: EMPTY states for when the weapon has
    run out of ammo (primary attack only), IDLE for when the player
    hasn't used the weapon for a while, WARMUP and SECWARMUP for
    showing a "spin-up" animation, and finally DISCARD / SECDISCARD
    states for reloading a weapon which wasn't empty.

  - RELOAD states for monsters.
  - SEQUENCE command for ANIMS.DDF.
  - can specify a colour directly in COLMAP.DDF (no lumps needed).
  - flags for friendly monsters: ULTRA_LOYAL and SIDE_IMMUNE.
  - better control over explosion damage (EXPLODE_RADIUS command).
  - WHEN_APPEAR in DDF and RTS now accepts simpler syntax.

  * That was just a summary.  See the 1.29 ChangeLog for more...


Known Issues:
  - Multiplayer (networking) does not work yet.  We have made a
    little bit of progress recently, for example you can play
	deathmatch with bots.  We plan to get LAN-based multiplayer
	working in the next release.

  - Drag-and-drop does not work in Linux.

  - Joysticks do not work.  We haven't done any work in that area.

  - Levels and TCs designed for EDGE 1.24 (or earlier) can produce a
    bucket-load of warnings when starting up.  These warnings are
    mostly about DDF features that have been removed or changed.
    Hence some older stuff will not work 100%.  Use the -nowarn
    option to turn off these warnings.

  - Some sprites are designed to look sunk into the floor, typically
    corpses, and can look like they are "floating" in EDGE.  This is a
    limitation of using OpenGL rendering (if the sprites are lowered,
    they get clipped and this looks a lot worse).

    Certain other DOOM tricks, e.g. flat-flooding, sometimes don't
    work properly with EDGE's renderer.

  - Bullets can sometimes pass through solid extrafloors.

  - The console has very limited functionality.

  - Certain colourmaps (especially Fog) don't work.


Troubleshooting:
  - If EDGE crashes, or otherwise misbehaves, please help us by
    reporting the problem.  To do this check out the EDGE website at
    http://edge.sourceforge.net.  We appreciate input because if you
    don't tell us about a bug, we can't deal with it.

  - Post the EDGE.LOG file which EDGE creates along with your bug
    report, as this contains lots of useful information to help us
    track down the problem.

  For Windows:
    - Ensure you are running with virtual memory ENABLED.  This will
      cause some real problems if it disabled.

    - You can check the DirectX version by running the DirectX
      diagnostic tool.  Click the Start button, then Run..., and 
      type: dxdiag and press ENTER.  If that doesn't work, try looking
      for DXDIAG.EXE in the following directories:

         C:\windows\system
         C:\program files\directx\setup\
         C:\winnt\system32

    - For EDGE to work, you need a 3D card *plus* OpenGL drivers for
      it installed on your computer.  A really low framerate (1 FPS)
      usually means that the *software* OpenGL driver is being used (not
      what we want, of course ;).  Go to the website of your card's
      manufacturer and look for a recent 3D driver.  Another place to
      look is on Microsoft's site.  Basically, if Quake 3 (or some
      other OpenGL game) works, then EDGE should work too.

    - SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH GRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OR WITH
      THE ENGINE LOCKING UP PLEASE ENSURE YOU HAVE THE LATEST VIDEO
      AND OPENGL DRIVERS FOR YOUR MACHINE.

      Users of the ATI Rage series are recommended to upgrade to the 
      latest drivers since some older drivers (circa 2001) have been 
      known to cause a lockup during startup.

      Voodoo3 is known to have problems, since the only OpenGL
      drivers that exist for it are very old and buggy.

  For Linux:
    - SDL 1.2 can be found at http://www.libsdl.org/.

    - You can check whether hardware 3D rendering is available by
      running the 'glxinfo' program in an xterm, and look for the line
      that says "direct rendering: Yes".
