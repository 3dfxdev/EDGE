EDGE 1.31 README.TXT
====================

Welcome to EDGE, the Enhanced Doom Gaming Engine.

Website: http://edge.sourceforge.net

Archive listing:
  * edge32.exe         - EDGE Executable (OpenGL rendering)
  * edge.wad           - EDGE WAD Information, version 5.8
  * SDL.dll            - Simple DirectMedia Layer, version 1.2.13
  * Changelog-131.txt  - Changes since 1.29
  * Edge-Readme.txt    - Guess what you are reading?


System Requirements:
  - Pentium 400 MHz CPU or later.
  - 64MB RAM (128MB RAM recommended).
  - Hardware accelerated 3D card with OpenGL drivers.

  - Either a DOOM, DOOM II, or Final DOOM IWAD file.
    (See "Getting hold of game data" below).

  For Win32:
    - DirectX 7.0 or higher.

  For Linux:
    - SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) version 1.2.
    - glibc 2.


Getting hold of game data:
    You can get hold of FreeDoom from freedoom.sourceforge.net which 
    is _free_ and has been produced by fans of the game in their
    spare time, or you can purchase "The Ultimate Doom", "Doom II" or 
    "Final Doom" (Plutonia/TNT) from id software at www.idsoftware.com. 
    The shareware data will also work with EDGE. You need to copy the
    .WAD file you want to use into your EDGE directory. The wad names 
    and what game they belong to are listed below: 

    doom1.wad    -> Shareware Doom.
    doom.wad     -> Doom/Ultimate Doom.
    doom2.wad    -> Doom II
    plutonia.wad -> Final Doom (Plutonia)
    tnt.wad      -> Final Doom (TNT)


Useful Parameters:
  * Screen size: -width [screenwidth] -height [screenheight]
  * Colour depth: -bpp [depth]  (2 for 16-bit, 4 for 32-bit)
  * Windowed mode: -windowed
  * Fullscreen mode: -fullscreen
  * Pick IWAD file: -iwad [main wad file]
  * Play PWAD file: -file [addon wad file]
  * Jump to level: -warp [mapname]  (in the form of MAP01 or E2M9 etc..) 
  * External DDFs: -ddf [dirname]  (use external DDFs in 'dirname')
  * Show EDGE version: -version
  * Disable sound: -nosound
  * Disable music: -nomusic
  * Disable warnings: -nowarn


Notable EDGE features:
  - Extrafloors (3D floors), removing the original DOOM limitation
    which didn't allow rooms over rooms.  EDGE supports real 3D
    room-over-room, bridges, and liquids.

  - DDF (Data Definition Files), allow Mod/TC/PC creators to
    completely customise monsters, attacks, weapons, pickup and
    scenery items, linetypes, sectortypes, intermissions, ETC...
    using fairly simple to understand text files.

  - RTS (Radius Trigger Scripting), provides per-level scripting
    support, allowing custom scripts to run when the player enters
    certain parts of the map, or performs certain actions, or when
    certain monsters have been killed (to name a few possibilities).

  - Hardware accelerated 3D rendering (via OpenGL).

  - MD2 models for monsters, items and player weapons.

  - Jumping, Look up/down, Flying (JetPack), Zooming.

  - Many limits and bugs from original DOOM removed.


Timidity Music Support:
    Timidity is a program for playing MIDI music, and EDGE includes
    has a built-in version of it.  For Linux users this is the only
    way to hear DOOM format music, but Windows users can use it too
    (see the Music Device entry in the Sound Options menu). 

    Timidity requires "GUS Patch" files to work, which are special
    sound data for musical instruments.  Under Linux you can simply
    install the 'freepats' package and it should work.  Otherwise
    a good quality patchset can be found in the idgames archive:
    search for "8mbgmpat", download the zip, create a folder where
    EDGE is installed called "8mbgmpat" and unpack the files into
    that folder.  Then run EDGE and the following messages should
    appear in the console:

    >  Loading Timidity config: ./8mbgmpat/TIMIDITY.CFG
    >  I_StartupMusic: Timidity Init OK


------------------------------------------------------------------------

(See the 1.31 ChangeLog for all the details...)


Known Issues:
  - Multiplayer (networking) does not work.  The type of networking
    that DOOM used back in 1994 is obsolete today, and EDGE doesn't
    have a suitable replacement yet.

  - Drag-and-drop does not work in Linux.

  - Joysticks do not work.  We haven't done any work in that area.

  - Levels and TCs designed for EDGE 1.24 (or earlier) can produce a
    bucket-load of warnings when starting up.  These warnings are
    mostly about DDF features that have been removed or changed.
    Hence some older stuff will not work 100%.  Use the -nowarn
    option to turn off these warnings.

  - Some sprites are designed to look sunk into the floor, typically
    corpses, and can look like they are "floating" in EDGE.  This is a
    limitation of using OpenGL rendering (if the sprites are lowered,
    they get clipped and this looks a lot worse).

    Certain other DOOM tricks, e.g. flat-flooding, sometimes don't
    work properly with EDGE's renderer.

  - Bullets can sometimes pass through solid extrafloors.

  - The console has very limited functionality.

  - Certain colourmaps (especially Fog) don't work.


Troubleshooting:
  - If EDGE crashes, or otherwise misbehaves, please help us by
    reporting the problem.  To do this check out the EDGE website at
    http://edge.sourceforge.net.  We appreciate input because if you
    don't tell us about a bug, we can't deal with it.

  - Post the EDGE.LOG file which EDGE creates along with your bug
    report, as this contains lots of useful information to help us
    track down the problem.

  For Windows:
    - Ensure you are running with virtual memory ENABLED.  This will
      cause some real problems if it disabled.

    - You can check the DirectX version by running the DirectX
      diagnostic tool.  Click the Start button, then Run..., and 
      type: dxdiag and press ENTER.  If that doesn't work, try looking
      for DXDIAG.EXE in the following directories:

         C:\windows\system
         C:\program files\directx\setup\
         C:\winnt\system32

    - For EDGE to work, you need a 3D card *plus* OpenGL drivers for
      it installed on your computer.  A really low framerate (1 FPS)
      usually means that the *software* OpenGL driver is being used (not
      what we want, of course ;).  Go to the website of your card's
      manufacturer and look for a recent 3D driver.  Another place to
      look is on Microsoft's site.  Basically, if Quake 3 (or some
      other OpenGL game) works, then EDGE should work too.

    - SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH GRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OR WITH
      THE ENGINE LOCKING UP PLEASE ENSURE YOU HAVE THE LATEST VIDEO
      AND OPENGL DRIVERS FOR YOUR MACHINE.

      Users of the ATI Rage series are recommended to upgrade to the 
      latest drivers since some older drivers (circa 2001) have been 
      known to cause a lockup during startup.

      Voodoo3 is known to have problems, since the only OpenGL
      drivers that exist for it are very old and buggy.

  For Linux:
    - SDL 1.2 can be found at http://www.libsdl.org/.

    - You can check whether hardware 3D rendering is available by
      running the 'glxinfo' program in an xterm, and look for the line
      that says "direct rendering: Yes".
