  - Pentium 400 MHz CPU or later.
  - 64MB RAM (128MB RAM recommended).
  - Hardware accelerated 3D card with OpenGL drivers

  - Either a DOOM, DOOM II, Final DOOM or FreeDoom IWAD file.
    (See "Getting hold of a game data" below).

  For Win32:
    - DirectX 7.0 or higher.
    - Videocard and Soundcard which is compatible DirectX 7.0.

  For Linux:
    - SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) version 1.2.

Getting hold of game data:
    You can get hold of FreeDoom from freedoom.sourceforge.net which 
    is _free_ and has been produced by fans of the game in their
    spare time, or you can purchase "The Ultimate Doom", "Doom II" or 
    "Final Doom" (Plutonia/TNT) from id software at www.idsoftware.com. 
    The shareware data will also work with EDGE. You need to copy the
    .wad file you want to use into your EDGE directory. The wad names 
    and what game they belong to are listed below: 

    doom1.wad    -> Shareware Doom.
    doom.wad     -> Doom/Ultimate Doom.
    doom2.wad    -> Doom II
    plutonia.wad -> Final Doom (Plutonia)
    tnt.wad      -> Final Doom (TNT)


Useful Parameters:
  * Screen size: -width [screenwidth] -height [screenheight]
  * Colour depth: -bpp [depth]  (1 for 8-bit, 2 for 16-bit)
  * Windowed mode: -windowed
  * Pick IWAD file: -iwad [main wad file]
  * Play PWAD file: -file [addon wad file]
  * Jump to level: -warp [mapname]  (in the form of MAP01 or E2M9 etc..) 
  * External DDFs: -ddf [dirname]  (use external DDFs in 'dirname')
  * Show EDGE version: -version
  * Disable sound: -nosound
  * Disable music: -nomusic
  * Disable warnings: -nowarn  (useful for 1.24 wads like QDOOMTST)


Notable EDGE features:
  - Extrafloors (3D floors), removing the original DOOM limitation
    which didn't allow rooms over rooms.  EDGE supports real 3D
    room-over-room, bridges, and liquids.

  - DDF (Data Definition Files), allow Mod/TC/PC creators to
    completely customise monsters, attacks, weapons, pickup and
    scenery items, linetypes, sectortypes, intermissions, ETC...
    using fairly simple to understand text files.

  - RTS (Radius Trigger Scripting), provides per-level scripting
    support, allowing custom scripts to run when the player enters
    certain parts of the map, or performs certain actions, or when
    certain monsters have been killed (to name a few possibilities).

///---  - Support for high resolutions (640x400 through 1280x1024), plus
///---    support for 16-bit rendering.  That's just software mode, there is
///---    also GLEDGE which takes advantage of hardware 3D acceleration via
///---    the OpenGL library.

  - Jumping, Mouse-Look up/down, Flying (JetPack), Zooming.

  - Many limits and bugs from original DOOM removed (e.g. no more
    visplane overflow or medusa effect).


???  - On multi-user systems (newer versions of Windows, and Linux)
???    the location for the config file (EDGE.CFG) and savegames has
???    moved, and is user-specific.  This allows multiple users to have
???    their own configuration and savegames.
???
???    To allow easy upgrading, we have included a tool along with the
???    EDGE binaries: UPGRADER.EXE.  You must run this first, before
???    running EDGE -- it will either move the files to the new place,
???    or spit out a message saying 'Nothing to do'.
???    
???    On Linux, the new location is the ~/.edge directory.  You can
???    either download, compile and run the Upgrader tool, or manually
???    move the edge.cfg file and savegames directory there.


Major changes in 1.29:

  * Software rendering removed.  blah... @@@@

  * MacOS X support.  initial version, blah... @@@@

  * OpenAL as the new sound system.  OpenAL is a 3D audio library which
    can take advantage of hardware sound mixing.


Bugs fixed in 1.29:
  + crash loading a savegame with dynamic lights when D/L disabled.
  + fixed crash when starting a level in deathmatch mode.
  + quotes (") usable in response files (for filenames with spaces).

  - arch-vile no longer resurrects monsters into itself.
  - fix for teleport on MAP06 (going to wrong place).
  - berserk strength now lasts the whole level.
  - night vision wasn't affecting the sky, fixed.
  - monsters on different sides now attack each other.
  - autorun is remembered in the config file again.
  - fixed some missing mid-masked textures (Eternal MAP28).
  - revenant missiles fixed to match the original.

  * Many more... See the 1.29 ChangeLog for the complete list.


General improvements in 1.29:
  + drag and drop support.  You no longer have to use the -file option
    to specify filenames (wad files etc).  Everything before the first
    option is considered a filename to add.  This allows you to drag a
    (self-contained) WAD onto the EDGE executable to play it.

  + support for OGG/Vorbis Music playing.  OGG/Vorbis is music format
    similar to MP3, but is free from patents and does not require any
    royalty fees.  You can use normal files, or lumps in a WAD.

  + built-in support for DeHackEd and BEX patches, using normal files
    (with .DEH or .BEX extension), and also the DEHACKED lump.  Patch
    files can be added with the -deh option (like in other ports).

  - new startup with progress bar.

  - Linux: fatal errors produce a pop-up dialog box, and EDGE can be
    run by double clicking the executable.

  - ability to use 32-bit screen modes (16.7 million colours).
  - support V3 GL-NODES, for very complex levels (Deus Vult MAP05).
  - detect Boom maps, and ask whether to change compatability mode.
  - support Boom's line-to-line teleports and platform toggles.
  - can toggle window/fullscreen mode in set-resolution screen.
  - sky improvements, including a stretch option in Video menu.
  - missing wad files (given with -file) now produce an error.
  - intermission text screens can now be skipped.
  - can disable mouse-look in the gameplay options.
  - console now slides up/down, smaller font.

  * See the 1.29 ChangeLog for more...


New DDF/RTS features in 1.29:

  + new IMAGES.DDF file.  The corresponding wad lump is DDFIMAGE.  You
    can define any type of images in this file (textures, flats, sprites
    and screen graphics), and they will override any from the WAD file
    with the same name.  Supports PNG and JPEG formats, either as lumps
    in a WAD or as external files.  Handles the full range of colours.

  + new FONTS.DDF file.  The equivalent wad lump is DDFFONT.  This is used
    to define fonts (the set of character images for drawing text).

  - new STYLES.DDF file.  THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL !!  The idea is to
    define the background colour/image and text font/colour/scaling
    information (and sounds too) for various parts of EDGE's user
    interface.  It may undergo significant changes (without keeping
    compatibility), and it might even be scrapped!  USE AT OWN RISK.

  + new RTS menu system:
    The RTS menu will pause the game (including all scripts) until the user
    presses a valid number key.  Savegames are also disabled while the RTS
    menu is shown.  specific part of script blah @@@@

  + weapon clip handling has been greatly improved (and made sane).

  + support for manual reloading (new key in Keyboard Options), and
    also next-weapon and previous-weapon keys.

  + Four new ammo types: DAGGERS, ARROWS, TORPEDOES, CRYSTALS.

  - There are new weapon specials, and they can be given to the primary
    and secondary attack independently (SEC_SPECIAL command).  They
	include: ANIMATED, NO_SWITCH, NO_TRIGGER, FRESH, NO_MANUAL and
	NO_PARTIAL.  Many of these control reloading behaviour.

  - Numerous new weapon states: EMPTY states for when the weapon has
    run out of ammo (primary attack only), IDLE for when the player
	hasn't used the weapon for a while, WARMUP and SECWARMUP for
	showing a "spin-up" animation, and finally DISCARD / SECDISCARD
	states for reloading a weapon which wasn't empty.

  - new support for weapon crosshairs.
  - new SEQUENCE command for ANIMS.DDF.
  - RELOAD states for monsters.
  - able to specify a colour directly in COLMAP.DDF (no lumps needed).
  - flags for friendly monsters: ULTRA_LOYAL and SIDE_IMMUNE.
  - better control over explosion damage (EXPLODE_RADIUS command).
  - FORCE_PICKUP special for thing.ddf (items).
  - WHEN_APPEAR in DDF and RTS now accepts simpler values.

  * See the 1.29 ChangeLog file for all the details...


Known Issues:
  - Multiplayer (networking) does not work.  We have done a little
    bit of work so far, and expect to have the basics working again
    in the next release (1.30).

  - Joysticks do not work.  We haven't done any work in that area.

  - EDGE is still somewhat slow.  Overall this is because we had
    little time to spend on optimising the code.  For software mode,
    part of the reason is that the old hand-crafted assembly routines
    are no longer used (they need re-writing).  GL mode also has its
    own speed issues, especially when dynamic lighting is used.

  - Levels and TCs designed for EDGE 1.24 (or earlier) can produce a
    bucket-load of warnings when starting up.  These warnings are
    mostly about DDF features that have been removed or changed.
    Hence some older stuff will not work 100%.  Use the -nowarn
    option to turn off these warnings.

  - Some sprites are designed to look sunk into the floor, typically
    corpses, and can look like they are "floating" in EDGE.  This is a
    limitation of the way EDGE renders everything -- it uses a
    new rendering technique that allows 3D floors, liquids, etc, but
    cannot duplicate the old renderer which allowed sunk-down sprites.

    Certain other DOOM tricks, e.g. flat-flooding, are also affected
    by the new rendering method, and either work to some degree, or
    not at all.

  - Looping sounds tend to stop when you get too far away to hear
    them, e.g. coming back to a flickering torch in QDOOM and it has
    stopped making the flickering sound.  Also looping sounds are not
    saved in a savegame, so after loading a level there are no looping
    sounds being played at all.

  - Some graphics can be more blurred than they should be,
    such as the title screens and the status bar background.

    This happens because many 3D cards (e.g. Voodoo 3) have a texture
    size limitation of 256x256 pixels, but some DOOM graphics are 320
    pixels wide -- because they don't fit, EDGE has to squash them.

  - The console has very limited functionality.

  - Certain colourmaps (especially Fog) don't work.

  - Teleport wipes don't work.


Troubleshooting:
  - If EDGE crashes, or otherwise misbehaves, please help us by
    reporting the problem.  To do this check out the EDGE website at
    http://edge.sourceforge.net.  We appreciate input because if you
    don't tell us about a bug, we can't deal with it.

  - Post the EDGE.LOG file which EDGE creates along with your bug
    report, as this contains lots of useful information to help
    us track down the problem.

  For Windows:
    - Ensure you are running with virtual memory ENABLED.  This will
      cause some real problems if it disabled.

    - You can check the DirectX version by running the DirectX
      diagnostic tool.  Click the Start button, then Run..., and 
      type: dxdiag and press ENTER.  If that doesn't work, try looking
      for DXDIAG.EXE in the following directories:

         C:\windows\system
         C:\program files\directx\setup\
         C:\winnt\system32

    - For GLEDGE to work, you need a 3D card *plus* OpenGL drivers
      for it on your computer.  A really low framerate usually
      indicates that the *software* GL driver is being used (not what
      we want, of course ;).  Go to the website of your card's
      manufacturer and look for a recent 3D driver.  Another place to
      look is on Microsoft's site.  Basically, if Quake 3 (or some
      other OpenGL game) works, then GLEDGE should work too.

    - SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH GRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OR WITH
	  THE ENGINE LOCKING UP PLEASE ENSURE YOU HAVE THE LATEST VIDEO
      AND OPENGL DRIVERS FOR YOUR MACHINE.

      Users of the ATI Rage series are recommended to upgrade to the 
      latest drivers since some older drivers (circa 2001) have been 
      known to cause a lockup during startup.

  For Linux:
    - SDL 1.2 can be found at http://www.libsdl.org/.

???    - 3D support under linux is still a developing thang, e.g. there
???      is no support for DRI (Direct Rendering Infrastructure) in
???      some distributions yet (notably Debian 2.2), as it requires
???      XFree86 4.0.
???      
???      Also required is a recent kernel (> 2.2.18 or > 2.4.0).  A good
???      guide to whether accelerated 3D is working is to run `glxinfo'
???      in an xterm, and see if it says "direct rendering: Yes".

Compiling EDGE:
  For All Versions:
      glBSP 2.10 is intended for use with this version of EDGE. All
      those people who download the source from CVS will need to
      add this to the source tree for the edge module. The directory
      name is in the format glbsp-x.xx - with the x's replaced
      with the version number.

      DEH_EDGE 1.3 is also required.  The directory name is in the
      format deh_edge_x.x - with the x's replaced with the version
      number.

  For Windows:
!!!!      - use the IDE project files: EDGE.VCPROJ for Microsoft Visual
!!!!      Studio, or EDGE.DEV for Dev C++ (a free C/C++ IDE). Users
!!!!      of the Dev C++ will also need to locate a version of the
!!!!      DirectX libraries for 8.1. 

  For Linux:
    - just type 'make' in the top-level dir.  This will create gledge.
      edit the Makefile in order to create the S/W version.

  For MacOS X:
    - type 'make -f Makefile.osx' in the top-level dir.
      NOTE: MacOS X support is broken right now.


Command line options:
