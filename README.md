## Development Builds
---
Occasionally we will package and upload builds for Windows and Linux. You can get these builds via [DRDTeam](https://devbuilds.drdteam.org/3dge/).
* IMPORTANT: these builds, despite the Git revision that EDGE reports via the console, don't always reflect the commit hash; often they will have their code or content modified in a way that is non-standard to official releases. We are working on an Autobuild system via Github - currently this is only usable for Linux.


## Build System for EDGE
---
To build EDGE, please see the [build guides](https://github.com/3dfxdev/hyper3DGE/tree/master/build_guide) and choose
based on your platform and compiler. Some of this information may be out of date; feel free to open up a Github Issue for assistance.

## Libraries
---
For the list of libraries required by EDGE, please see the
following document: docs/tech/libraries.txt.
##### You can also obtain the pre-compiled libraries by looking in the build_guide, depending on what compiler you are planning to use.
