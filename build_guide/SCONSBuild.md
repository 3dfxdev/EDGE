This build uses Sconstruct to build a Linux (or equivalent) version of 3DGE. You will find this in the root folder (appropriately named Sconstruct)

# Building with SCONS
---
1) Execute Sconscript (make sure the libs are build-beforehand and linked inside of the file)

#### NOTE: Most of the team does not use Scons, so it is unsupported!!! Anyone who builds with this system is encouraged to update this markdown file with more appropriate instructions.
