ANDY BAKER'S LOG

DATE: 2006/02/15

Patched the configure.ac to look for glbsp in the detect the header
in the root include directory (glbsp.h instead of glbsp/glbsp.h).

Implemented two patches from Darren Salt to make FLTK optional (plus
a bugfix that stopped linux/i_system.cpp compiling) and detection of
an external lzo lib.

DATE: 2005/12/28

Refitted 'nosound' back into the engine sound system.

DATE: 2005/12/02

Implemented epi::path GetDir() & GetBasename(), GetExtension(), GetFilename()
and stripped out M_CheckExtension().

Removed the unused M_ReadFile() and M_Writefile(). The wad handling now uses
the file_c object for file access. This means I can remove the far from
standard includes and EDGE's config.h won't have to balloon in size.

IWAD directory is no longer defaulted to the game directory as I felt that
custom games are unlikely to contain IWADs. This may need to refinement
to check IWAD, GAME and current directory. See how we go here I think.

Oh yeah, almost forgot. Best to hold the front page: I've done something
remotely constructive. The cache directory has been implemented. Combining
that with edge.log being written to the edge home directory and we have
an engine that can be installed globally on a linux box, but write to
user specific areas when needs be. Use of DOOMWADDIR environment var
is recommended to access global data, but any GWA file creation is done
in the users cache directory. 

RC4 just moved that bit closer.

The focus is completing the work required for release:
1) Handle 'nosound' in sound system properly.
2) Video depth switching notice.
3) C++ Exceptions.

DATE: 2005/11/29

Moved the EPI path methods from the filesystem class and into the
path namespace. Shortened the names since path is stated in the
namespace part. So IsAbsolutePath() has become IsAbsolute().

Looking forward to do something productive as opposed to this
continuing battle of refactoring :).

DATE: 2005/11/28

Replaced I_PreparePath(), I_PathIsAbsolute and I_PathIsDirectory() with
EPI filesystem methods. I_PreparePath() doesn't have a direct replacement,
instead we use JoinPath to append directory and filename where appropriate.  

DATE: 2005/11/25

We did only use I_TmpMalloc/I_TmpFree in one instance - in rad_trig.cpp
- for string allocation. As a result I replaced it with an epi::string_c
class and removed the definitions for i_defs.h.

DATE: 2005/11/24

Commited fixes (inclusion of correct headers) to linux code. Added
automake Makefile for lzo library. It was my intention to use the 
lzo library, but since its required for win32, I added it back into
the linux configure build.

DATE: 2005/11/23

Refactored the directory setup code. Added a cache directory to
be used for cached gwa and hwa files. Made the raw_filenames
table in w_wad.cpp a epi::array_c. Very tempting to go on a
spring clean and continue to strip out the Z_ code, but that
can be a further iteration of 1.29 after the initial
release. 

DATE: 2005/11/19

Added win32 headers with configure conditionals to the engine 
code and the epi.

Footnote to self: Handle C++ standard exceptions in e_main.cpp.
Also run ww-cash.wad on EDGE through the debugger.

DATE: 2005/11/13

Added a dummy config.h in CVS and made the move away from
including the world+dog mentality. This step is needed for
us to implement a proper configure script. It is also
helpful in respect of compile times. Have to plead
guilty on being the original architect to a now clearly
suspect idea.

Added the w_image_gl header. I didn't want to include
i_defs_gl.h in places where it wasn't needed and
only in source files, as opposed to header files. A good
example of this is am_map.cpp which has no need to know
anything about OpenGL, but it did require something else
in the w_image.h header. A quick grep shows that only
the rgl_* source files only use the methods in question.

DATE: 2005/11/10

Purged CVS of old directories. 

EPI now considered seperate project.

Mus2Midi extracted from EPI since it has no purposes beyond that
of the engine. 

Implemented system specific GL header.

Stripped out the include world+dog in the epi headers. This is to
allow for quicker compilation and ultimately support the config.h
which will be generated by the configure script.

Completed a first pass configure script with checks for
glBSP, humidity, epi & fltk checks as m4 macros. 

Produced glBSP, humidity & epi configure scripts which no longer
require any change of structure to the respective projects as
they stand.

DATE: 2005/10/23

Removed turkish translation as it was clearly suspect.

Implemented a basic NSIS install script for EDGE. It installs the
engine executable, ogg vorbis dlls, changelog, readme and an
option to install the standard DDFs zip. It creates short-cuts and
an uninstaller which work fine. 

Need to add:
* Display GPL Dialog.
* IWAD Location Dialog.
* Option to run the OpenAL Installer.
* DDF/RTS Online Install Option.
* Example WADs Install Option.

Sync'd the win32 makefile with the changes made to its linux
counterpart.

DATE: 2005/10/22

Starting committing the minor changes implemented for RC#3 Compiler
Config builds.

It appears that an assertion is raised in the M$ libs if isdigit()
is called with a negative value. This occured in FontParseCharacter()
where an extended character gets read. Fixed by verifying a value
is greater than zero before calling isdigit().

Used a epi::string_c to handle in the filename building contained
in M_ScreenShot. The sole benefit of this is cleaner code and is
not as efficent, but since screen shot taking is hardly the fastest
process in the world I left the change in. Originally, this was
implemented in an effort to track down an issue with screen shot
generation. This "bug" actually turned out to be an incompatibility
with the runtime DLL libraries between Visual Studio 6 and dotNET. I
should note at this point the solution is rebuilding the
offending libraries in dotNET; one would hope for a better fix
but the dotNET build is for testing purposes only, therefore it
goes on the end of a very long TODO list. 

Reimplemented the standard memory handlers for the engine. The custom
malloc has had its use, but seems a reasonable stab-in-the-dark to
resolve the random crashes that people have reported, but I have
never been able to reproduce at all. Judging by debug output generated
by one suspect machine - cheers Lobo - the crash seems always to
follow a delete[] call. 

Removed the USE_DL_PREFIX define: this was a custom malloc directive.

Renamed SDL/i_system.cpp to SDL/i_loop.cpp. Neither GNU Automake or
Visual Studio are happy with a source filename being used in multiple
different directories.

Removed -fno-rtti (debugging move) for Mingw and stripped out generated 
include directives that where a hangover from the dev-c++ generated 
Makefile.

We now link against SDL 1.2.9 instead of SDL 1.2.8. This seems to fix
a crash on exit that we were experiencing on Win32. The "Why" is unclear.

Fixed a bugette in ChangeToExeDir() - Win32's i_main.cpp - where a
buffer was a character too small. Tidied using the epi::string_c for
the buffer. 

Test for __func__ preprocessor keyword now: #If __GNUC__.

Added missing M_PI define to M$ Win32 section in epi_win32.h.

Made sure the latest version of deh_edge is being used for win32 builds.

Modified the code to use the epi, glbsp & humidity as if they were in the global
name space. So <epi/someheader.h> instead of "epi/someheader.h". A prelude
to supporting 'configure'. Treat deh_edge as if they are
a subdir of the engine tree and no longer specify a version number. The
config.h will detect version numbers and enforce that contract if needs
be.

Defined USE_HUMID in i_music.cpp as opposed to the Makefile, another 
configure option that will go in config.h.

DATE: 2005/10/19

Having provided a release containing three engine executables (RC#3 
Compiler Config) for people who might have had previous random CTD issues
for testing. I set my mind to the ten remaining tasks for the project's
1.29 release:

1) glBSP Configure Script - Needed as an EDGE configure script prerequisite.
2) Humidity Configure Script - Needed as an EDGE configure script prerequisite.
3) Sync codebase with changes made for compiler-config builds
4) Handle 'nosound' in sound system properly.
5) Video depth switching notice.
6) EDGE configure script.
7) Sync codebase with changes made for configure builds
8) Build Win32 Installer.
9) Release candidate #4 - Win32 Binary.
10) Release candidate #4 - Linux Sources.

Asssuming that all goes smoothly we'll ready for a christmas release.

In the meanwhile I have to make changes to our website for when the
old sourceforge mysql database is taken offline.

DATE: 2005/10/08

Fixed a small code oversight in image_jpeg.cpp.

DATE: 2005/09/19

Introduced a defaults header file so we have only one place to 
configure the default config setting. The screen size defaults
have been added to this.

Applied the voodoo doll patch supplied by dsalt.

Implemented a configuraton option for the screenshots (with
regards to my solution for bug #1222174) in the video menu. It is
now possible to select either JPEG or PNG as your preferred
choice for screenshot output.

Prepared EDGE 1.29 for release.  

DATE: 2005/09/17

Implemented an FXFLAG_IGNORELOOP flag. This overrides the effect 
definition and is used by the StopLoopingFX code to handing pending 
effects correctly. Previous they were just stopped which resulted in
some platform effects not being played.

Added a '-bestaudio' parameter for win32. This replaces '-forceds'. 
Due to the number of issues with regards to dodgy 3d audio drivers,
I thought it best to force the use of "DirectSound" as the driver. The
'-bestaudio' will make OpenAL select what it considers to be the best
audio drivers. 

Win32 Icon added to CVS and removed the obsolete resource files.

Implemented a fix so that the Win32 MessageBox is now displayed on exit
when required.

Implemented a quick fix to stop the sound playback of platform
planes in stasis. The crusher on MAP06 which can be stopped by
walking over linedef previous did not stop the crusher effect.

DATE: 2005/09/08

Fixed a few sound effect generation issues:

1) The call to StartFX() is given a valid origin but a NULL sound 
prior to refactoring would cause any effect linked to the origin 
to be stopped. This behaviour has been replicated and the related 
issues (plane moving effects not been stopped) have been fixed.

2) Sector ambient effects not ceasing on level exit. Its noteworthy
that previously the looping and distance calculation was handled
within the sector playsim code. It is also noteworthy that these
effects always loop regardless at a rate of 7 times a second. We
retain this behaviour unless the effect is flagged as looping (the
sound system does proper looping) and we now ensure that all ambient 
effects are stopped on level exit. A new P_StopLevel() method calls 
P_StopAmbientSectorSfx() which handles the required behaviour. 
P_StopLevel() exists to perform any required cleanup without 
deleting any allocated resources.

Not bad for a right-handed person with a broken right hand.

DATE: 2005/08/08

Fixed a bug in SetAllocatedSize() which resulted in the sound system
referencing uninitialised data.

DATE: 2005/07/24

Added code for persistent effects (reserved fx) channels. Its a bit
hacky in places but does its job of allowing the music effects to
work. Reinstated the basic distance calculation and set a category
limitation func in place. DDF Priorities are no longer supported.

DATE: 2005/07/10

Implemented category prioritisation. Very simple and very effective. The
actual calculation of the category limits still remains: currently each
category will have a minimum of 3 effects playing.

Need to introduce code that will allow allocation of a fx structure
inbetween Ticker() calls. This is required for music playback channels.

DATE: 2005/07/02

Retrofitted the Win32 code with the SDL library. I had previously 
resisted the need to use the SDL because it was my opinion that our 
finely grained code was more suited to EDGE. Since the testing of 
the see-through-walls bug (#1180553) seems to indicate an initialisation 
problem. It was felt that the SDL would be a useful comparison. Having 
to implement the SDL highlighted that it does provide all the necessary 
hooks to win32 data (main window handle etc..), so as a result it has 
been decided to use the SDL for Video and Control routines.

Noteworthy changes in regards to SDL:

i_ctrl.cpp now handles whether the application is active or not and 
what happens when the application has gained/lost focus. 

An i_system.cpp has been added which holds the I_Loop() 
method. This now calls I_ControlGetEvents() each loop to ensure 
that application activation event is caught. 

The engine namespace now has an 'idle' function. This is called when 
the application has lost focus. 

E_ReleaseAllKeys() has been added to e_input.cpp. The purpose of 
the function is to generate keyboard events to release all keys 
that the engine thinks are down. This is called by engine::Idle() 
to ensure that keys are not left down. This can occur when an ALT+TAB 
combination is used, since when the engine is given back control, it
does not get an event to say the ALT key has been released and in the 
default key config will result in the playing strafing when then 
intended to turn.

The handling of application switching does work in gnome (tested by 
hacking in an iconify on ALT+TAB), however getting it to ALT+TAB (or 
whatever the WM manager uses) will need some work.

DATE: 2005/05/30

Implemented a effective but nasty singularity handling. 
I've preferred to over-engineer this bit of code in order to
keep the initial start effect code to a bare minimum. Considering
the number of effects it will process with the sinularity test,
I don't think it _that_ wasteful. Although I do accept that it
is somewhat sub-optimal, as is all the sound system at the present
time.

DATE: 2005/05/13

Implemented Pause/Resume functionality. Have introduced a flags field
on the pending effect (pending_fx_t) and effect (fx_t) structure. The
purpose of the flags field is currently limited to effect which do not
get paused. This is required since Effects are now paused by the ticker 
function in response to a pending_state variable being set to pause).

An aside relating to OpenGL window rendering in Win32. It would
appear that the main window will need to be destroyed and recreated
for resolution depth changes to be properly restarted. I had played
with the used of either an 'owned' window or a 'child' window to
be used for rendering, but this appears to rather fiddly. 

DATE: 2005/05/09

Reimplemented proper positional data and volume control. 

DATE: 2005/05/08

Spent the last couple of days constructing a queue system for pending 
sound effects; this has effective become a rewrite of the entire sound
system for the engine, since it includes merging in the OpenAL code.

The mechanism for builting up a list of pending sounding, producing
a combined list of pending/playing effects and then evaluating those
effects to determine those which should remain playing and those
would should cease is complete. Although the exact logic for picking
the effects has yet to be finalised. 

The system specific startup/shutdown code has been temporarily
reimplemented in AL/i_sound.cpp (should a version in each system 
specific directory) and a sound caching system reimplemented.

I have know reach a point where I have merged the playback/stop/stoplooping
OpenAL into the engine and this appears to work fine. 

DATE: 2005/04/11

Added the category type to the S_StartSound() call. This is prelude 
to biasing of the limited number of sound channel/sources code. 

DATE: 2005/04/08

Implemented a fix for bug #1176231. This is where the depth of the
desktop (and hence the window) was not being changed when requested. This
needs testing as I have a problem with my main windows PC where a series
of res changes will result in nothing been drawn apart from the mouse.

DATE: 2005/04/05

DDFinWAD 1.3 packaged and released.

DATE: 2005/04/04

Fixed an outstanding bug with the teleport spawner (thing 7101), the
final frame remains on screen and doesn't disappear. The last frame
is now NULL and gives the effect of the teleport flash disappearing.

DATE: 2005/04/03

Footnote of two bugs to document: Plutonia MAP16 (Raising -> Falling 
Platform) and both raising stairs in TNT MAP30. Both issues prevent 
completion of their respective maps.

DATE: 2005/04/02

Stripped out the TRANSLUCENCY flag for global/levels. This did
not actually do anything in the GL Renderer.

Picked an issue with the lines.ddf file, it contains a '/* ... */' style
comment (C style). Its interesting thats in the file since this comment
format is not supported. This problem was detected when I had a brief
chance to review my pending parser code which will currently reject the
comment start characters.  

DATE: 2005/03/26

Added three parameters for the use with audio:

-audiodev <device-name>  - Forces OpenAL to select <device-name> device   
-forceds                 - Forces OpenAL to select "DirectSound" device
-maxaudiochan <n>        - Sets the maximum number of playing audio
                           channels at once

These have been created as possible workarounds for buggy drivers in
the Win32 environment. Although only '-forceds' is win32 only.

Fixed an issue where only the first mixer in Win32 was being tested; hence
MUS playback not occuring on these devices.

DATE: 2005/03/18

Fixed a possible infinite loop condition. The win32 mixer detection code 
was not incrementing the loop if the mixerGetDevCaps() failed.

DATE: 2005/03/14

Restructed the Win32 OpenGL startup/setscreensize/shutdown code. Apparently 
SetPixelFormat() is only allowed to be called once on each window. Since
our choice of pixel format doesn't change I felt it appropriate to set it
once on startup as opposed to every call to I_SetScreenSize().

DATE: 2005/03/07

Implemented the screen mode list object (scrmodelist_c). This replaces
the old scrmodes/numscrmodes combination and now deals with the various
find, next & prev routines that would scattered about the code. It
greatly simplifies the logic in m_option.c. A noteworthy change to the
code has been the removal of the "changeresneeded" boolean and srcmode
struct. This combination has been replaced by a "newres_idx" var which
when non-negative is an index in the scrmodelist object. 

Updated the copyright headers for all source files.

DATE: 2005/03/06

Started to look at the resolution selection code with an aim of fixing
various issues. Primarily, it is to add the actual system depth value in
the screen mode structure: the hope is that this will resolve the issue
of depth value being listed as available, but the opsys will not switch 
because a different actual depth is used. For example the case of 15 bit 
colour is given by the system, but 16 bit colour is send back by
the engine and is failed. Along the way I plan to fix problems with the 
V_FindClosestResolution() not resolving back to the same res that
was selected: I plan to sort and cleanup the list of resolutions
as each one is added to the list on startup. Relying on 
V_FindClosestResolution() when an exact match exists is somewhat lazy.    

DATE: 2005/02/21

Fixed the window positioning issue on Win32. The code was not resetting the
position of the window for fullscreen display modes. 

DATE: 2005/02/19

Since crc and md5 are both math-type functions, they now have 
a math_ prefix. This follows a request for this from Andrew Apted.

DATE: 2005/02/18

Normalised the naming of source files in the epi lib. Where
the change of name could come into conflict with standard
headers, it was decided that the best case was normal to go 
with the plural version of the name if possible. This is the 
full list of renames:

epiarchive -> archive
epiarray -> arrays
epiassert -> asserts
epibasicimage -> basicimage
epibytearray -> bytearray
epicrc -> crc
epiendian -> endianess
epierror -> errors
epifile -> files
epifilesystem -> filesystem
epimacro -> macros
epimalloc -> memalloc
epimd5 -> md5
epimemorymanager -> memmanager
episound -> soundsystem
epistack -> stacks
epistring -> strings
epitimestamp -> timestamp
epitype -> types
epiutil -> utility
linux_epi -> epi_linux
linux_epifile -> files_linux
linux_epifilesystem -> filesystem_linux
macosx_epi -> epi_macosx
win32_epi -> epi_win32
win32_epifile -> files_win32
win32_epifilesystem -> filesystem_win32

DATE: 2005/02/16

Hacked together a fix for bug #1123377. An issue I picked up
on a play through TNT MAP16 where stairs were not raised, but 
created by dropping sector heights. The code for stairs is 
something of a hack: the moving plane's destination
height is adjusted according to the movement of the first step 
regardless of what the subsequent calls to P_SetupSectorAction() 
determine. This actually worked fine where the first step
was calculated to move in same direction as the following steps;
however the set of stairs triggered off by linedef #2116 on
this map did not. The solution is an improvement on the original
hack where a function is called to set direction and speed
based off a new start and destination. Nasty, hacky, horrible;
but it works. Story of my week in development. Explicitly
set the linedef types to a speed of zero in lines.ddf to override
any defaults in the code and force compliant behaviour.

Must really finish that elevator code some time....

DATE: 2005/02/10

Tweaked the EDGE Makefiles for mingw + gnuwin32 binutils compile. 

DATE: 2005/02/06

Had a play with numbers to support EDGE's volume scale and 
"Attenuation By Distance". This is approximate; but appears to work 
for my configuration. Testing in the field is going to ensure that
I have to revisit this one.

The previous distance calc has been removed from the EDGE sound 
code and we now rely upon the underlying audio library. As such the 
sound interface has been modified accordingly. Noteworthy are:

* I_SoundPlayback() no longer takes a parameter for panning as this
  was required for the engine's old distance/volume/pan.

* I_SoundAlter() has been renamed to I_SoundSetVolume(); it now
  longer has a panning setting as described above.

* I_SoundSetListenerOrient() Created. Takes two floating point
  vectors which are the at and up positions of the listener. 
     
* I_SoundSetListenerPos() Created. Sets the listener position.

* I_SoundSetPos() Created. Sets the sound position of a given
  "source".
     
* I_SoundSetRelative() Created. Sets whether the sound position is
  given to be relative to listener or not. The primary use is effects
  that sit directly on the usage.

* AdjustSoundParams() Removed (s_sound.cpp). This handled the
  offseting of the panning and volume for the old distance calc.

These functions are unashamedly OpenAL-centric, but I suspect further 
tweaking will involved the creation for a class for audio playback or
not use system specific functions at all and stick with OpenAL calls
in code, the same way OpenGL calls are embedded.

Couple things for the TODO:
* Change to 'up' vector in regards to mouse-look. 
* Validate usage on 5.1 sound; the stereo headphones don't cut it.
* Check the soundvolume calc setting is correct.

DATE: 2005/02/02

Generated Makefile's for the Dev-C++ 4.9.8.0 environment. The reasoning 
is simply that Makefiles are easier for crossplatform developers to
maintain compared to project files for either Microsoft C++ (be in
VC6 or .NET) or the Dev-C++ environment. 

DATE: 2005/02/01

Implemented 3D Positioning to the audio system. The positioning code 
works itself, however the volume adjustment needs to be completed. 

DATE: 2005/01/05

This marks the 6th year on my involvement with EDGE (Obsessed? Perhaps).

I'm happy that OGGs are OK stored as external files. People who
don't like that can like it or lump it. Quite literally in fact: The OGG 
player now supports lumps :). 

In addition I found that using ov_read() on win32 generated some obscure 
errors related to file opening. This was fixed by setting up the 
fread/fseek/ftell/fclose handlers explicitly. This should probably 
use the epi::file_c object in future.

DATE: 2004/10/29

Implement the #define storage method in my lexer class. The only
remaining hash directives work is the version checking.

DATE: 2004/09/17

Began implemented hash directive processing in demo. 

DATE: 2004/09/15

Began writing the C++ version of the lexer prototype. The output
remains the same however the internals will be modified to use the
more coder-friendly top-down approach. This is where the parser will
read a token and the call a function to parse through the rest of the
token until it requires to revert. This is different to a state
driven read mechanism (the bottom-up method) of "I'm reading this token 
and I'm in this mode therefore I do this", which is somewhat more
primitive and more complex to manage. 

The handling of hash directives will be run in the lines->chunk
processing, but will not alter chunk output. Although it possible
to handle chunks in this manner, this would break backward-compat
with the existing DDF Parser. Instead a table will be created that
may be referenced at a later stage by the objects derived from
the lexer if they so wish.

DATE: 2004/09/02

Decided that since RTS is heading for a more involved scripting role
that it was better to make it a little more complex. The initial
phase - splitting into lines and then chunks (i.e. minus remarks
and whitespace of no consequence) needs to be enhanced to pick up
hash directives. I believe this to be correct behaviour since #defines are 
normally dealt with prior to any other parsing. Any C compiler will direct
its output via a preprocessor prior to any actual processing it does 
itself.
 
DATE: 2004/08/31

Continued the prototype of the tokeniser for DDF. Going well since DDF is
quite nicely a primitive language. Although it does suffer a few problems
with characters being reused. The best sample is the hash - used for
redirection in states and hash defines. It does not look too complex to
work around this round though.

Have decided against replacing all the Z_Zone code for our next release
since the a lot of the code that I'm having the rewrite will be rewritten
with the introduction of the new WAD system. I don't have that much free 
time :(.

DATE: 2004/08/27

Began prototyping a tokeniser for DDF in python.

DATE: 2004/08/26

Stripped out any Z_Zone headers that could be extracted. Completed
the implementation of ddf_base_c which includes use of the epi crc 
class and the epi strent (string entity) class. 

Started looking at building a tokeniser for the DDF stuff since the
parser as a whole appears to be a bench mark test for the use of
memory allocators. A tokeniser will enable more efficent use of 
memory and a faster processing time.

DATE: 2004/08/25

Continued to replace Z_New() / Z_Free() combos with new/delete. As part
of this I've began replacing the ddf_base_s struct with a class. This may
seem a little bit of sidetracking from replacing the Z_Resize() stuff, but
having looked at the WAD stuff and the amount of work it will entail to
fix it, I felt that more time needs to be taken to produce a more OO-based
solution.

DATE: 2004/08/24

Removed the win32 console window.

DATE: 2004/08/23

Removed deleted headers previously used by the software renderer. 

DATE: 2004/08/20

The OGG Player now works in Linux. After handling some 
underrun - restarting a stopped buffer when data was
availble - it now works. The issue detailed below
was caused by underrun at the beginning of the level. 

Fixed an issue where the Close() on the player didn't
update the status and therefore was causing an error
when trying to Play() another ogg. Muppet.

Special mention to Erik Sandberg's contribution to EDGE. Its
worth a note he did a shedload of quality work for and
made a special effort to make sure we were GPL legal -
something we maintain now - I do this since because we have
recently removed the software renderer, we removed about
90% of the work he put into EDGE.

DATE: 2004/08/19

Continued the stripping out of the software renderer. This is helpful since
I can remove a few things from my list that use Z_Resize().

DATE: 2004/08/18

Implemented an OGG Music Player via OpenAL. This seems to work without problem
on Windows. Reading from  memory (a lump from a WAD) appears to be a simple 
modification, this is the only work outstanding apart for volume which is also 
an easy job.

Note: Ogg Vorbis Precompiled Win32 libs only work statically
linked and even that has to use a multithreaded debug DLL.

There appears to be a problem with OpenAL on linux with either
alGetSourcei(source, AL_BUFFERS_PROCESSED, &processed) or
alSourceQueueBuffers();. Since the update seems to work
only once.

oggplayer.cpp/.h got added to the AL directory simply because
it is AL specific. Ideally this will be moved into the main
source tree when OpenAL becomes the only sound handler.

DATE: 2004/08/17

Implemented a binary-tree + linked-list solution to handle the drawthings
array. No array object was used since I wanted to avoid doing any alloc(s)
altogether in the routine.

DATE: 2004/08/16

Implemented the deathmatchstarts (now dm_starts) as an epi::array_c 
(spawnpointarray_c). Could do the same for the playerstarts.

DATE: 2004/08/15

Implemented the buttonlist as an epi::array_c. Wouldn't this be better
called switchlist?

DATE: 2004/08/14

Turns out that alcMakeContextCurrent() with a NULL parameter is the cause of
our lockup for OpenAL. Had a look ath alutExit() function for Linux and it
doesn't call it. This is done for windows however. Took out the call for linux -
probably should use alutInit() & alutExit() and emulate it where missing. The
I_SoundStopLooping for OpenAL now works. I need to look into why the chainsaw
effect does not appear to be playing correctly.

Implemented an epi::array_c for the storedsfx in the OpenAL code.

Tided up the m_menu.cpp string handling. Dynamically allocated input and message
strings replaced a host of statically allocated fixed buffers.

Note to self: need to start implementing epi::error_c for the throwing mechanisms
in the epi::string_c.

DATE: 2004/08/13

Implemented the removeque in p_mobj.cpp as an epi::array_c; this is start of
stripped out the Z_Resize() calls.

M_ComposeFilename() and G_FileNameFromSlot() now take a epi::string_c instead
of returning a string that requires de-allocations. Seems a tidy short term 
solution.

I think this conversion process will learn to some addition directories for
holding classes and containers since leaving them in just inserted into code is
not the tidiest solution. We can do that once we've finally removed Z_Zone.

DATE: 2004/08/11

Started picking through the allocations used for strings only and replacing them
with epi::strent_c.

DATE: 2004/08/10

My concern with OpenAL on win32 boiled down to library support for MinGW (minimalist
GNU for windows). As it happens there are libraries for the compiler (via
the DEV-C++ interface) and as such it compiles without problem. The current
test implementation seems to work without issue although I need to preform more
extensive testing. 

DATE: 2004/08/09

Completed the list of required changes related to Z_Resize(). I will effect the things
I'm certain of to start with. Those that require work will work to the epi will be
altered towards the end of this series of changes.

DATE: 2004/08/06

Compiled a list of required changes for data that uses Z_Resize(). This operation
itself is somewhat inefficent and indicates that data should be built as a container. 
There are going to be instances where a resize() is an apt action, but we need to
look at other options first. 

con_*.cpp:
	Rewrite. Break up into seperate parts: console_history, console_executor (does
	the work when the console command is passed), console_renderer (takes history 
	and prompt to render) and console_prompt. Sounds like a lot of work, but the EDGE
	console does very little at present and writing one is a simple action especially 
	with the new epi::string_c & epi::strent_c now in active use.

ddf_main.cpp:
	defines/numDefines - Build variable epi::strtable_c class.

ddf_stat.cpp:
	redirection_names - Use epi::strlist_c class
	states - Form from an epi::array_c class
	
e_net.cpp:
	Remark out and start again!

r_data.cpp:
	R_InitFlats - F_lumps - use i32array_c class
	
r_layers.cpp:
	solid_rects - Form from an epi::array_c class

r_things.cpp:
	sprites - Form from an epi::array_c class

rgl_unit.cpp:
	RGL_DoSplitQuadHoriz() - quad->verts & AddPolyDynPoint() - poly->verts:
	Need to refer to Andrew Apted on these. I think that we should consider 
	removing the need to realloc() here since the golden rule of not malloc()ing 
	each frame and I would hazard a guess that this is happening here. However
	without a firm understanding of how the rendering works in full I'm not
	best positioned to deal with it. I could realloc() in the short term.

sv_chunk.cpp:
	SV_PutByte() - cur->start - Use realloc().

v_colour.cpp:
	LoadColourmap - cache->baseptr - Use realloc()

v_res.cpp:
	V_AddAvailableResolution() - scrmode - implement epi::array_c

w_image.cpp:
	ADD_BYTE() - buf_start - Use realloc()
	rim->block_cache & rim->trans_cache - Use epi::array_c

w_textur.cpp:
	tex_sets - implement epi::array_c

w_wad.cpp:
	data_files - Use an epi::array_c
	data_files[].flat_lumps - Use an i32array_c
	data_files[].patch_lumps - Use an i32array_c
	data_files[].sprite_lumps - Use an i32array_c
	lumpmap - Use an i32array_c
	lumpinfo - Use an epi::array_c
	lumplookup - Use an epi::array_c
	wadfiles - Use an epi::array_c

DATE: 2004/08/05

Sorted out the remaining stack arrays for drawfloors, drawthings, drawplanes and 
walls. Since this was rendering code, I was not wasteful and ensured that data 
was not being freed and allocated unnecessary - it would of been very easy to rebuild
the arrays for each frame, but there would of been something of performance hit here.

I stripped out the Openings code - it was used in software mode only and would of
required extra work to replace openings array - and shifted any functions that were 
required by the GL code from r2_bsp.cpp into rgl_bsp.cpp. 

Having completed the removal of the stack arrays, I removed the code from the
Z_Zone itself. The stack array itself was a tidy bit of code it is own right but
had to replaced since it didn't fit it into the object oriented C++. epi::array_c's
are not necessary any better in how they behave, but they do allow us to control the 
allocation and deallocation of objects that they contain.

Four things (and not small things these) remain:

1) Z_Malloc/Z_Free need to be replaced by new/delete.

2) Address all the Fixme!!'s created.

3) Restructing the source code: currently objects are scattered left, right and 
centre - these need to be tidied

4) Implemented epi::error_c throughout the code. Start at EPI level and move through 
the app.

DATE: 2004/08/04

Started work on the rendering arrays. This is going to be fun....

DATE: 2004/08/03

Added an end-of-array pointer to the epi::array_c, along with the every increasingly
useful ZeroiseCount() method. The end-of-array pointer allows for the iterator to check
its valid without have to calculate the end of the array. Also ZeroiseCount() is a
method for simply setting the count of the array to zero without clearing the data
down. Useful if you don't want to destroy data or if you wish to avoid the overhead
or rebuilding the array and it doesn't matter if objects are not destroyed.

Implemented the real_images stack array as an object and put in a temp (and as yet
untried fix) for the ONCONDITION <weapon> bug - #1002106.

DATE: 2004/08/02

The intercepts array has been replaced with an epi::array_c based in 
p_maputl.cpp. May require a tiny bit of optimisation in the scan
loop since the iterator does too much maths. 

DATE: 2004/08/01

Fixed an issue with the GetTailIterator() function return an iterator with a negative
value. This occured on arrays where the size was zero. Since I felt it inefficent to 
check the index value in the iterator class itself (since it should never happen), 
I made sure the iterator returned had a value of zero if the array it came from is 
zero. The IsValid() on the iterator will fail in this case.

Looks like the only reason for creating a local copy of the spechits array was
that P_TeleportMove() cleared the array. Since there appears to be no good reason
for this I removed the clearing of the array from P_TeleportMove().

Implemented the spechit array as an object of linelist_c. Line list is an array 
of pointers to line_t*, but it does not attempt to clear up the lines on deletion.

Footnote to self: GAP_RemoveSolid() loads data into an array of set size, but doesn't 
check that the data goes out of bounds. Its a possible crash bug on extreme levels,
but it is possible it never reachs this level.

DATE: 2004/07/31

The purpose for structuring the DDF structures into full-blown classes and containers
class is simply to remove the old style Stack arrays. This process is complete in
terms of actual work, but it should be added that a cleanup operation is required -
most notably to each thing that has been labeled with a FIXME. I would liked to have
overhauled the states[] table, but I don't wish to be sidetracked at present.

I need to deal with the stack arrays that exist outside of DDF. Fortunately there
are only a few of these. The first to be looked at is the "spechit" array. Its purpose
appears to hold lines that have been intercepted by a thing's movement. Erik has added
code to take a local copy when these lines are being processed since it is believed
that functions that are called during the line processing alters the "spechit" array
itself. I'm currently checking in what way this spechit line is affected during this
process and if there is a better way of handling this in a new list object.

DATE: 2004/07/29

Removed the wad_epifilesystem files since I don't expect it to be packaged as
part of the epi, it will most likely been a DLL or so file. Also removed
the used ddf_parser files since I do not expect them to be used.

Stripped out chat_macros: Pointless since we have no multiplayer at present and
maintaining this is work we don't have time to do. This was not done out of a 
drive to cut out dead wood: language references in DDF_MainCleanup() were
causing me a headache when I moved the language selection routine into e_main.cpp
and out of being hacked in DDF_LanguageInit().  

The new language interface is now complete and it now reminds me why I walking 
away from any "refurbishment": it takes a while debugging a shed load of code thats
been sat in the theory stage for a couple of days. However, it is done and only 
requires some minor optimsations. 

Footnote to self: Some funky char-encoding stuff has appears to have altered some 
foreign language characters - need to check they're still come out right.

DATE: 2004/07/28

Began implementing a new language definition parser handling. I have tried over this 
period of conversion to using container objects of not reworking the code as I felt
that I'd never finish, however I'm making the exception for the language stuff since 
it very different to how the other DDF code works.

Put simply the existing code will be written to use an buildinfo object to store
the data used in parsing the files, the data in this object is them put into a
more compact format (saving on mem) and the object is destroyed. 

DATE: 2004/07/27

Introducted the strbox_c object to epi. This has a similar relationship to strlist_c
as strent_c does to string_c. As such strbox_c is a container for a group of strings,
but there is very limited capacity for manuipulation, whereas the strlist_c can be
built up and then pull apart at leisure. There are intended to interface from
each other and both have a Set() function to load data from the other. The internals
of strbox are a block of data containing the string, an integer containing the size
of the data, a list of pointers referring to strings within that data and a size
count. This does not carry as much bulk and cause as much memory fragmentation as
the strlist_c object.

The primary intention for their use currently is the language definition.

DATE: 2004/07/26

Implemented a epi::strent_c (String Entry). The purpose for this is to act as a 
container for null-terminated string which is dynamically allocated. The purpose
here is just to contain, not to manipulate. String manipulation is handled 
very well by the epi::string_c class.

DDF_MainGetString() now loads up a epi::strent_c class and all DDF objects have
bee amended to use this structure. 

I'm moving towards using a string table for longer term strings since dynamically 
allocated objects come with a 8-byte overhead and that we'll want to avoid for
things that are not in a constant state of flux. 

DATE: 2004/07/25

Converted the sfx to use containers. I've done enough for it to work as it did, but
there is a memory leak in the way that the system works. In order to cater for sound
effects that use strings which include wildcards, we return a point to an sfx_t. This
sfx_t is a structure of varying size which holds the number of effects that match 
the given key and then an array of ints which point to entries within the 
sfxdefs list. Under most circumstances the pointer return actually points at data
with the sfxdef_c (each one contains a single self-reference) for exact matches, 
otherwise a new sfx_t is allocated. The problem occurs that one cannot delete the
sfx_t since it can point to one in an sfxdef_c. Therefore we need to work out a way
of managing these sfx_t, most likely in a container of its own. I decided this can 
wait until the OpenAL revolution.  

DATE: 2004/07/24

I've got a working WinXP install to hand, so I have something else to test on. I
quick download of 1.28a shows there is an issue with key presses being 
registered. For the most part the keys respond well enough, but the major hole is
pressing SHIFT to run. It doesn't work with any consistency and this is pain for
the player who still uses this method to run. I shall need to look at this in
detail before our next release.

DATE: 2004/07/23

Took time to investigate the libraries needed for png and jpeg support. Getting
any library to work takes a bit of tweaking, but knowing that we'd been using 
the mainstream un*x/linux compiler GCC on a windows platform (otherwise known as
MinGW) throws us a few issues. Firstly, most of the makefiles written are build 
with a full GNU toolset to hand which is not the case if you've downloaded 
MinGW. Secondly, Microsoft's Visual C is the dominent development environment on
the windows platform and on some projects there is more support for this, rather
than the MinGW environment. 

Starting with libpng I downloaded and my aim was to at least compile a DLL for
this. One prerequiste is the zlib compression library which can be downloaded
freely and compiles OK from the gcc Makefile provided in the win32 directory.
Libpng itself was a little more frustrating: the makefile.cygwin (nearest
relative to MinGW to produce a DLL) relies upon the existence of the full GNU 
toolset and I ended up creating a DEV-C++ project file using the settings 
extracted from makefile.cygwin. This requires a little more investigation and 
probably a submission of a patch to the libpng maintainers. Either that or
EDGE will have its own src dist for win32 libpng.

Libjpeq was difficult in a different way. The code for this was sourced from
gnuwin32.sourceforge.net (which I later found had a libpng dist) and as such 
contained a relevant Makefile provided. However, this required a few bash 
scripts of its own to compile. Not having to have time to dig through and 
install a whole bunch of scripts, I replaced the offending bash script (o2dll)
with the appropriate call to dllwrap and a build of the library prior.

After a tweak of the EPI (including the images files) and an enabling of the 
test within thee EDGE. This compiles, links and runs OK. Although I haven't 
actually used the code in anger at the moment. This will be possible once I've
gotten hold of the Doom2 Texturing Project's data on CD. We'll see how well I
hack when that happens...

Had another look at putting SDL in use on Win32, but again felt that the
work involved didn't necessary merit the results. The SDL is nice and tidy -
from scratch it may make a great deal of sense, but we have a tidy interface
which does work well enough and only needs a few tweaks are needed to resolve 
outstanding issues. 

Onto DLLs. Nice idea, f*cking 'mare to maintain. Thats my opinion and its
really not changed a great deal over time, so much so that EDGE remains 
statically linked on windows where possible. However with the inclusion of more 
features - PNG, JPEG, Font Rendering, OpenAL etc..., its probably time to bite 
the bullet and deal with the problem. Conflicting DLLs appears to be most 
problematic and will most likely occur for people who use the source ports and 
EDGE in the same directory. As a result I think we've going to need to put these
DLLs into a seperate directory which will not conflict. Something that can be 
delayed until crunch time.

In terms of what can be put in DLLs and their Un*x like shared objects appear
to be purely C functions, they were never really meant to deal with classes 
within C++ and hence don't. Although I stand to be corrected as I've not dug 
deep into the subject. 

The glbsp plugin appears to be a viable candidate for moving a DLL - I think 
Andrew Apted may have suggested this himself. The other chunks of code I'd like 
to move out the main executable would be the DDF/RTS parsers. Why? In the same
way that a glBSP DLL would allow for editors to build the node info for
a level, it would enable them to get information from DDF and RTS without
parsing the files themselves. The interface would be interesting, but I suspect
that a very limited SQL language with object containers replacing that of
database tables, so for a thing search:

SELECT * FROM things WHERE name = "IMP";

would return a data object with all the entries for the "IMP" thing. Although I 
would  imagine that the game would load the contents and then ditch the library. 
A couple of hurdles exists, notably the remaining links into engine code. 
Stripping out the parsers will remove a shedload of strings and static objects
that just sit wasting space after initialisation. Also the containers can be
allocated at the correct size and in singular arrays as opposed to being built 
up as a list of pointers. 

Its noteworty that every piece of dynamically 
allocated memory carries at least 8 bytes overhead. So the memory saving could 
be significant. 

The savegame code could be a target for this approach since it 
is built in a similar way to DDF; Although I doubt it would be of much use to 
developers of Editors :).

Back out of the land of random thought and onto making the DDF_Sfx code into
objects... 

DATE: 2004/07/22

Fixed a few glaring errors in the current revamp: Notably the weapons
lookup was trying to use the mobjtypes FindFirst(), whereas the
mobjtypes Lookup was using a global reference as opposed to itself.

Converted damage_t to a damage_c with copy constructor and Default()
method. This is handy since it removed the need for 
copy-every-member-of-the-struct code blocks. label_offset_t is now
also a class.

DATE: 2004/07/21

Completed work on ddf_weapon.cpp and made weaponkey a class. Will
commit tommorrow.

DATE: 2004/07/20

Continued work on ddf_weapon.cpp and its move to use the 
weapondef_c/weapondef_container_c classes. Looks like 
weaponkey[] will have to be converted to a class in order
to manage the memory it allocates for the weapondef_c
pointer list.

DATE: 2004/07/19

Completed making all the changes required to implemented the
container type and classes for weapons in DDF. I've left the
weaponkey[] array alone since it does not rely upon the stack
array system and will need to be reimplemented if improved
anyhow.

DATE: 2004/07/18

Found and fixed 2 compile errors. 1) rad_act.cpp was not up-to-date 
in CVS. 2) A recent installation of apache has overwritten the
fnmatch.h in /usr/include. This resulted in warnings of INLINE
being redefined and a deliberate syntax error in <png.h> relating
to <setjmp.h> behind included prior to <pngconf.h>.

DATE: 2004/07/16

Looked at various implementations for font generation. This is
something of sidetrack until I resume the weapons definitions.

DATE: 2004/07/14

Started on the weapon definitions.

DATE: 2004/07/10

Gone a bit mad with the renaming, but I did feel it important that we
were consistent and clear. Its a bad habit, but the rest of the world can
catch up with this conversion table:

donut_t           -> donutdef_c
elevator_sector_t -> elevatordef_c
extrafloor_info_t -> extrafloordef_c
ladder_info_t     -> ladderdef_c
lightdef_t        -> lightdef_c
linedeftype_t     -> linetype_c
litetype_e        -> lighttype_e
mobjdef_c         -> mobjtype_c
moving_plane_t    -> movplanedef_c
sliding_door_t    -> sliding_door_c
specialsector_t   -> sectortype_c
teleport_point_t  -> teleportdef_c

This only includes changes to names with the linetypes/sectortypes commit.

I have completed the line and sector changes for the new containers, although
this code will require extensive testing. I'll stick together a short test plan
for use when the rest of the memory management conversion is complete. 

The remaining changes are states, sound effects, weapons and languages. 
Languages being the considered the slight oddity, so it is being left to last 
on the DDF changes.

Bit concerned about the executable is putting on a little weight for
what it being added. Maybe this will be balanced out when I strip out 
Z_Zone.  

The eagled-eyed among you may notice a slight gap in my recent commit for
the linetypes/sectors. I'm probably the only coder recently who had to be 
halted in commiting code to CVS to pick up his motorbike from being serviced...

Note to self: Check that saving/loading on a boom level works. I'm
concerned that the code may not handle generalised linedefs.

DATE: 2004/07/09

Completed the parser functions for lines and sectors. As it stands the code
compiles, links and runs OK. Although the donuts and generalised 
lines+sectors have not yet been implemented.

I intend to create additional linetype_container_c & sectortype_container_c
objects to hold the generalised types. It seems to make sense for the 
game engine to manage these. It will call DDF code where necessary to create
the lines/sectors, but apart from that the engine can manage it. This seems
the most consistent way of handling this. Although I had considered modifying
the existing containers, but that would be messy when attempting to maintain
the current behaviour. Since it is possible that someone relies upon this.

In the future, we may wish the consider the possibily of loading lines.ddf on
a pre-level basis. If that becomes true we can dispense with the additional 
containers.

Starting remote debugging using gdb from one linux machine to the other. Quite
friendly to setup. Works well. Such is the effectiveness of debugging tools
under Linux, it picks up a SIGFPE deep down in the mesa GL drivers for my Radeon
when starting EDGE. It appears to be safe to ignore and is not picked up if
the executable in run without a debugger.

Interesting stat of the day: The largest IWAD released offically for the 
doom was TeamTNT's evilution (tnt.wad), its size is 19Mb. Switch on all the 
debugging info for gledge and the epi library - the size of the executable
is 32Mb. It would appear that the engine ate all the pies.

Added a branch to CVS for the 1.28 release. The tag is "stable-128".

Note to self: Need to look into donuts use the data and how best we can 
implement a solution using the new classes.

DATE: 2004/07/08

Footnote to self: Add 'const' to the assignment operator 'rhs'. This is
consistent with GCC - and I assume correct construction.

Implemented 90% of the sector & linedef types. I'm at the stage where 
the codebase currently compiles and links OK. The remaining code is the parser
functions, Boom handling and donuts. 

The objects which are embedded into linetype_c and sectortype_c are fortunately
of similar construct. So it become suitable for me to generate a little PHP script
for outputing these classes. It could be argued that Python would of been more
suitable, but the time taken to write the script did save me a lot of time. May
consider putting some kinda of generic developer tools into the edge CVS. It will
come in handy if we do many more structures to full class conversions.

DATE: 2004/07/07

EDGE 1.28A RELEASED.

DATE: 2004/07/06

Implemented the body of the linetype_c class (replaces struct linedeftype_t).

DATE: 2004/07/05

Since the interface for this line/sectors code is pretty settled already, I took 
the route of changing the code outside of DDF and then fill in the gaps when it 
all compiles cleanly.

Also fixed misc warnings (unsigned/signed comparisons) and a kernel header
include in epiendian.h. Use <asm/byteorder.h> directly isn't proper, so <endian.h>
has been included instead as per warning suggestion.

DATE: 2004/07/03

Got myself up and running on Linux (Fedora Core 2/ 
Kernel 2.6.5 / GCC 3.3.3), since my Win2K bit the dust last night.

As a result I just completed the outstanding initial work for
lines and sectors. Although I did get the opportunity to test
the OpenAL sound libs for Linux, which seemed must more responsive
that the normal SDL sound. The one problem is that is don't seem
to want to exit and causes X stability issues.

DATE: 2004/07/02

Started work on converted linedef structures to classes. I suspect that
sectors will get changed at the same point since the two are linked in
places.

DATE: 2004/07/01

Fixed a few crash bugs that got introduced with the new code. Firstly, I 
didn't set the currgamedef pointer. It did highly a few issues with the
current setup, but the new code - an extra parameter to G_InitNew() and
a deferred pointer for gamedef - is no worse that the previous code. Another
ones of those battles for another day.

I didn't set the defaults properly for the text display in intermissions 
and as such no text was being displayed, it even managed a nasty lockup on
Doom II MAP30's exit message. Setting the defaults correctly has fixed this.

DATE: 2004/06/30

Finished all the ddf_levl changes. Compiled - and briefly - tested. I had
to tolerate the currmap being set in DDF_LevelCleanup(). The engine doesn't
respond well to this being NULL. Thats another battle for another day: it
falls over during initialising the menu defaults in m_option.cpp. 

Have I graduated to a hardcore open source developer? Well using 'gdb' for
win32 must elevate me up the scale, but actually using windows is the big
downer :). 

DATE: 2004/06/29

Keep running into strings that need are dynamically allocated, but are changed
rarely (if at all) and would be wastful if implemented as a epi::string_c. The
overhead in that structure suggests itself as a class for modifying a string in
the short term. A longer term class is needed, whose only element is a
char* and the methods exist only for gaining length (via strlen) and for copying
about. This fits with the Java concept of a string object which holds a string
and a string buffer object for pulling apart a string and rearranging as 
appropriate. Thats will most likely get written once the old stack arrays are
stripped out.

On that note, I've made further in-roads in updating the DDF code with objects
and epi::array_c's. This is very much akin to crossing the desert, but each 
DDF file marks progress and ddf_levl.cpp (map definitions) is all but complete. At
the time of writing I have made the mapstuff_t & finale_t structures into the 
mapdef_c & map_finaledef_c classes respectively. The remaining bits to light this
bit of the progress bar are fixing the compile errors and testing the code itself. 

One of the things I have tried to do during the conversion process has been to
ensure that the containers are very much self-contained and don't rely on external
dependencies with themselves and the EPI. Apart from a useful programming exercise
it will allow for the code to be modularised in library form. I suspect that all 
the objects and containers will go in a ddf_objects.cpp/h and ddf_containers.cpp/h
eventually. The ddf_main header will of course include these, but will retain
their extern definitions. 

I mention the above since I quickly added a 'game' namespace (whether this will 
have a usefulness in the longterm remains to be seen) whose only function is 
LookupMap(). Ideally, we would have used the Lookup() method on the mapdefs 
(class mapdef_container_c) object, but the code used the W_CheckNumForName() 
function for checking the existence of the lump. That would be failing the 
greater good if this was done inside DDF and hence got added to g_game.cpp within 
the 'game' namespace.

I shifted the current and next map extern definition in the g_game header, since
they were declared in g_game.cpp.  
 
DATE: 2004/06/28

It would appear that GCC and MSVC seem to work out which operators to use 
differently. The comparison operator on the epi::string_c will work fine
under MSVC, but GCC will complain that its not sure which to use. Hence the
rule of thumb is to be explicit. Therefore the code

if (s2 == "#END") { /* ... */ }

is better rewritten as:

if (s2.Compare("#END")) { /* ... */ }

The change above I have been required to make in ddf_game.cpp actually uses the 
CompareNoCase() method since DDF should not be case sensitive.

Picked up on a possible race condition that locks up Win32 on startup. It seems to
be on the first call to I_ControlTicker()->ReadKeyboard() call. I've not been able
to reproduce it 100%, but it occurs when the startup has to read the WAD from disk 
as opposed to using windows disk cache. 

On the bright side, the world intermission code has been completed and tested. I've
also managed to fix the bug where the map has no next map (i.e. end of an episode), 
but still displays the "Entering" headline.

Most of the remaining work for world intermission screen was tied up in added 
assignment operators to the wi_*def classes in DDF.

Fixed a bug where the attack mobjdef's we being created, but not being added 
to the list. This showed up as a result of loading a savegame which contained
an active projectile. 

Ensure that the copy constructors all have related assignment operators.

Spend half the day getting my secondary machine to support OpenGL on the X 
server. It does render OK in software mode, but it is pig-slow. Mainly due being
a Pentium II 400. I shall be raiding my parents machine for their TNT2... :)

Stripped out on all the in-game data from the wi_* classes in the DDF area; I
also made a naming adjustment to each to indicate them to be definitions. Implemented
a wi_c class to wi_stuff which acts as container for all the ingame data. This
is placeholder code until we strip out the interface.

DATE: 2004/06/25

Starting making adjustments to wi_stuff.c; I think that we should treat everything
read in by DDF as read-only data copy. I'll make the change to this tommorrow.

DATE: 2004/06/24

The initial DDF stuff has been sorted for gamedef_c. Since I've made the
correction of moving wi_map_t -> gamedef_c, I now have to sort how the 
intermission code works for it to make sense. The code currently takes a 
copy of the gamedef data and works with it for all the intermission screens. I
suspect we'll move away from this and have a purpose build class with contains
gamestate data and a pointer to the gamedef_c. It'll probably be only the
wi_stuff.* which needs changing initially. Can't see wi_stuff lasting much
longer (assuming we have the time) as its not really configurable as it stands. 

DATE: 2004/06/23

Implemented gamedef_c plus its container class in basic form. I need to
update the remaining DDF Code (and remove where necessary) and then update 
the major engine code. 

DATE: 2004/06/22

Implemented the wi_anim_c, wi_frame_c & wi_mappos_c plus their container
classes in basic form.  

DATE: 2004/06/21

Continued on implementing the gamedef_c class (replacement for wi_map_t). The
whole game definitions code looks to have been written initially to replace the 
intermissions screens ('wi' prefix = world intermission?). 

Not sure what to do with the bg_camera[] entry. I will probably leave it as its 
not doing any harm, even if its a little untidy - its based off the assumption
that mobj names can't be longer that 32 characters. The entry itself holds the 
name of a mobj type to use as a camera position in the intermission screens; but
I suspect that'll be ripped up when we start doing screen layout DDF (menus.ddf).

DATE: 2004/06/15

Seems fairly obvious that we have a memory trashing bugs. The original level are fine
since they don't push the engine, but find a few more complex levels which push the
engine will result in a crash. Beyond the obvious checking, I'm not going to do
anything about this until the new memory manager has completely replaced the
z_zone code. 

DATE: 2004/06/14

Implemented a strlist_c class (_not_ a string table as mentioned on 11th). I
just need a list of strings for the titlepics array in wi_map_t. I also added
two int array classes (one for s32_t's, one for u32_t's). These new additions
form the new epiutil.h/cpp files.

At the moment I've got the idea of extending the wad filesystem in my head. The
current one is pretty basic and I've have a task listed for a new format for 
some while. The whole purpose is to make it possible to support a filesystem, 
the idea being that someone would not need to compile to a wad before a release
and that file extensions could be used to identify files etc. There isn't
a reason why the current WAD system could not be built upon to support this. This
is however a note for the future and not something that should be attempt now. I
do need to nail the idea down first.

DATE: 2004/06/12

Fixed a bug whereas the OpenGL code was not allowing a res change on Windows 95.

Took a copy of the 1.28 codebase and applied the fixes from the 1.29 codebase. This
will form our 1.28a release, which is a bugfix for 1.28.

DATE: 2004/06/11

Had a look at the wi_map_t structures in ddf_game.cpp. The structure is an
oddity since it contains arrays which get created when parsing the DDF file. I'm
not sure I'm keen on too many arrays within arrays. Also I need to implement
a stringtable class - maybe integrated in the EPI. I don't think that storing
an array of epi::string_c is sane since of the overhead that comes with them and
should anyone want to manuipulate the data they can be loaded into an epi::string_c.

I aim to create a branch of 1.28 and implement the fixes from the
version in CVS (minus EPI implementation) at the weekend. Leaving it a couple of
months before fixing the crounching bug would be rude.

DATE: 2004/06/10

The class colourmap_t has replaced struct colourmap_t. Couldn't really justify
changing the name to include a def.

Noted that Lookup() methods should need to throw an error and that this should be
handled or ignored if appropriate.

DATE: 2004/06/09

The class atkdef_c replaced the struct attacktype_t and atkdef_container_c has been
added to act as container. 

Since DDF is the world of definitions, I've made a point of using the def in the
terminology. Hence why mobjinfo_c also got changed to mobjref_c. Its not as though
I've just the find and replace in files shortcut...

Next up ddf_colm and colourmaps.

DATE: 2004/06/08

I decided to change all ddf-built structs to classes for the following reasons:

1) Implement CopyDetail() method for copying all data except the ddf id
when the entry has been finished.

2) To Replacing the static template with a Default() method. This is essentially for
use in the constructor and for clearing the buffer object down after it has been copied. 

3) Allow for greater control over objects and pointers within objects that require
management on deconstruction.

Objects changed thus far:
animdef_t -> animdef_c
dlightinfo_t -> dlightinfo_c
haloinfo_t -> haloinfo_c
mobjinfo_t -> mobjinfo_c
pl_entry_t -> pl_entry_c
switchdef_t -> switchdef_c

Completed the necessary work on mobjinfo_container_c class. Although I need to revisit
the savegame code - the lookup() in SR_MobjGetState() replaced a loop with took no
account of disabled objects. At first glance it would seem that a disabled
object would never get saved. However I need to go over this. It should be understood
that maintaining the momentum of the change is more important than checking the fine
detail at the point. Once everything is in a position to settle - i.e. all the stack
array is removed - then I can revisit these points, if they remain relevant. Appropriate
use of the "FIXME!!!" is recommended. 

DATE: 2004/06/07

Started implementing the mobjinfo_container_c class. This one will require more than
the basic functions due to many ways that mobjinfo are referenced.

DATE: 2004/06/06

Working on implementing the mobjinfo_t struct and a container class for it. I think that
mobjinfo_t would benefit from being converted into a class in order to properly
cope with copying this object about. 

Added the ability to get & set the position of the array_iterator_c class. The iterators
are beginning to be my preferred method of array access and as such this functions fill 
a void, whether or not it is a purist use of an iterator is something I do not know.

DATE: 2004/06/05

Implemented a lumpname_c class for the purpose replacing the char[10] defs that are 
used for storing lump names. Although I need to check why we are using 10 chars for
a lumpname since I belived the maxname to be 8 + the null.

DATE: 2004/06/04

Changed playlist_* to pl_entry_*. I did write it originally and have to 'fess up 
to it not making natural language sense, so it got fixed when implementing the 
container for playlist entries.

Major panic on as I found a heap error on MAP30 of scythe.wad. Since I'm working
with the memory code at the moment the concern that I had checked-in a
memory overwrite bug. Panic over when V1.28 did the same thing. Its a problem, but 
something I don't have to concern myself with immediately.

Made sure we were cleaning up the info data if replacing an existing playlist entry.

Implemented switchdef container class. Switchdef was previously called 
switchlist_t, this is another that didn't really make much sense, so it became
a switch definition.

Knocked down the DirectX requirements so that it will work with version 3 or
later. The latest version doesn't provide any features we use.

DATE: 2004/06/03

Implemented a GetTailIterator() in epi::array_c. Means you can now search from
back to front. 

Took the plunge: meaningful code now uses the EPI. The animdefs array has been
replaced with the animdef_container_c class. This is our first step in stripping
out the Array handling in Z_Zone. 

I've added a few helper #defines into epiarray_c. Neatly converting from an 
iterator to a type or pointer and primitive array construction are now handled.

Two footnotes to self:
1) Use just the one log file (EDGE.LOG and debugfile to be combined)
2) Get around to finishing the elevator types.

DATE: 2004/06/02

The code that tracks the stats in epimalloc attempts to add in allocations made by
"foreign" allocation calls. The code will takes the gap between the new and old
memory pages and assumes this to have been used. This is problematic if windows
goes off and gets a page of memory say over 32Mb away for its last page! - which it 
was doing with alarming consistency. Decided that we were only interested in memory 
pages allocated  by epimalloc and nothing else. (Wipes sweat from brow). Thought that 
was going to be a nasty one. 

Started stripping out the obsolete Z_Zone functions. This will make it easier to
focus on those that are actually used. The following have been stripped out thus
far:

void Z_CheckHeap(void);
int Z_FreeMemory(int level);
int Z_UsedMemory(int level);
bool Z_CheckIfZero(const byte *ptr, int size);

DATE: 2004/06/01

Fixed a problem where we used a Win32 API call that did not feature in Win95. As
a result the GetFileAttributesEx() has been with a call to FindFirstFile()/FindClose()
mechanism. This is detailed in the docs as being supported in Win95. Needs testing that
the next version will work and this is the only missing function call.

Corrected the coding standard doc (indents increased from 2 to 4) and added sections for
classes and namespaces. I'll let them evolve until I formalise. My view is that docs
should never cover the detail until the detail has been tried and tested. The big
mistake in programming these days is to design everything at the beginning.

The memory code is returning odd values for the size (noticed when it tripped the 
memory size checking). Definitely need to fix this before any committing. Nothing
nasty detected when playing my current favourite PWAD for Doom II - its called Scythe 
(highly recommended). 

DATE: 2004/05/31

Started work on getting the EPI used by the engine proper. Decided that it was probably
best to perform any integration piecemeal. So much as I would like to convert everything
at once, the reality begs to differ. A couple of years ago I would of been very critical
of such an approach, however I'm a little more pragmatic now. Still sucks thou ;). 

Created an engine namespace and created functions Main(), Loop() and Tick() to replace
E_EDGEMain(), E_EDGELoop() and E_EDGELoopRoutine() respectively. Main() takes the 
standard main() parameters now, which is passed to M_InitArguments(). The call for this 
is stripped out of the system specific code for all platforms. The reasoning for this
change is to allow for the EPI to be initialised prior to *all* engine code and
we don't need any params for the EPI init.

Main() calls Startup() which does all the engine initialisation that E_EDGEMain()
used to do and returns true if Loop should be called. Ideally Startup() and its
sub-routines will throw an epi::error_c in future, so checking the return
value would be unnecessary. A try/catch block encapulates
the Startup() and Loop(), which means the program *will* return to this point
by throwing an error - maybe I've retained a little more idealism that I
expected. The catch statement only handles epi::error_c at present, I don't
see any reason to change this. 

I won't be committing this to CVS just yet - its just the beginnings of
a bigger change and it doesn't have that much impact. Only sound handling current
does new/delete in the C++ style.

DATE: 2004/05/30

Berzerker caused a crash if you a theortical target was being used. Turns out that
a recent change was checking for the radius of an object from its info; a theory
target has no info and hence bailed at this point. Fixed this in two ways: 
DecideMeleeRange() would always return false if a dummy target was being used (its used 
to determine whether an attack sound and autoaim is made for the player). In addition the
code now computes damage if the CLOSE_COMBAT attack does fail - this handles the
situation of damage being done to other objects apart from the target. Also
I made the code use the actual radius for the calculation since it is conceivable 
that the radius of the object would change during its lifetime.

Fixed the Arch-vile resurrecting non-solid objects and trapping itself. I fixed this is
in the resurrect respawn code a while ago.

ALT+TABing under windows does not trigger the TAB 'key' in the game. For most 
people this means that the map-toggle will not kick in.

Set initial volumes for CD & MIDI to zero. This has the effect of hiding a 
delay in setting up the mixers following playback.

DATE: 2004/05/16

Tested for an hour and updated the readme.

DATE: 2004/05/15

Be careful of what you predefine. Spot the difference:
1) #define FL_ROUND(f)  ((int) (((f) < 0.0f) ? ((f) - 0.5f) : ((f) + 0.5f)))
2) #define FL_ROUND(n)  ((int) (((n) < 0.0f) ? ((n) - 0.5f) : ((n) + 0.5f))) 

The variable arg is f instead of n. Why is this a problem? VC's preprocessor
will attempt to replace every 'f' - including those that suffix the numbers
with the contents of 'f'. Rule of thumb? Preprocessors - especially those 
included with with M$VC - are thick as pig sh*t. Example 2) works as intended. 

Stopped console's PLAYSOUND from generating a fatal error. This is a temp fix
until our next release which will hopefully involve a decent try/catch
mechanism.

DATE: 2004/05/09

Moment of inspiration and sheer-bloody mindedness has enabled me to add the 
code to control the mixers under win32. Once you understand how the mixers
work, if becomes a lot easier to handle. Each device has mixer and various inputs 
(source) and outputs (destinations) and that MIDI and CD are treated as sources.
Therefore you need to apply the control to the source and it works once you
get past the protracted windows structures. Although given the different devices,
I supposed one could argue the complexity is justified.

Adjusting the operating system volumes is probably _not_ recommended practice. 
However, it works. I made a point of restoring on exit, the values on entry.

This mixer code has been hacked a bit since this will all be in the epi at
some point in the near future.

One alternate way of controlling the midi volume would be to adjust the
midi channel volumes by the current volume and emulate volume control.

Verified that win32 was rounding to nearest on all calculations excepting
casting to another intregral type.

DATE: 2004/05/02

Spend time debugging the linux epi functions. The upgrader tool was developed on
the win32 platform via a cross platform lib (in this case the epi) and as such
the linux filesystem code needed a little testing. 

Firstly, rewrote the Copy() function to use try/catch/throw. This made sense since
all the code that would have to be written for each failure in the function. Also
fixed abug where the Copy() was reading the dest_file's length for how much it 
should read. Clearly another CIB (Caffiene-induced bug) :(.

Onwards, Close() was going into infinite recursion. This happened due to file
(linux_epifile) class calling the filesystem Close() function in its deconstructor.
This is correct behaviour, the incorrect behaviour existing in Close() where
it was not NULL-ifying the filesystem pointer in the file class. This allows
for people to destroy a file object without needing to Close() it first.

Onwards again, ReadDir() was returning OK, but not loading any contents. My first
port of call was the fnmatch() call which turned out to be quite correct. This
is a nice little function for comparing a string with a regular expression. I had
originally thought that it should be returning a value != FNM_NOMATCH in order to
be correct, but == 0 is correct like most posix functions. Next function call
was stat() it was refusing to read each file given stating that the file did not
exist. Since we were passing a filename with no path, it was using the current
directory which was usually not the directory being read. Therefore we store the
current dir, change to the directory being read and revert back on exit. 

The upgrader tool works fine and I didn't have to modify the code of the actual
program at all.

Not a bad days work since I had to download+compile+install the latest version 
of GDB since the dev machine I work with has an upgrade of GCC with no matching
upgrade of GDB :). 

DATE: 2004/04/04 -> 2004/04/29

Worked on the upgrader tool, which is to make use of the epi where appropriate. This
is the first real test for the library, so it has taken a little longer than expected
to develop what is after all a very simple command-line application.

The very first problem I encountered was a linker issue on Dev C++. Visual C++ had 
compiled and linked OK, but our open source alternate was having none this - so far
as it was convinced sbrk() was not defined. My initial thinking was that sbrk()
was an external lib function and this would explain the linker error. It turns out that
sbrk() is implemented in epimalloc.c and that its prototype differed slighty
between an external and the statically declared function. As a result Dev C++ was
linking to an extern function (ignoring the static function in epimalloc), whereas
Visual C++ treated them as one and the same. Remove the extern declaration for
win32 and it all works. Thanks the slocombe (user at sourceforge.net) for pointing
out a detail that led to this fix.

Since I was going down a pure C++ route for this app, I added an error class for the 
purpose of throw-ing. The class itself is a glorified container whose constructor
is used for setting up the data neatly. I found it helpful to contain a string and
code within an error as this makes reporting easier. Since this error class is
intended to be thrown by the epi and by an app, there is a flag embedded in it
which indicates whether the error in an epi or app error. The codes for epi errors
are held in the epierror.h itself, but the codes for the app can be determined
by the app. One yet unwritten piece of code is something for displaying
an epi code & string combination.

On the subject of throwing, I encountered a feature that sits in Visual C++, but
it prohibited by GCC 3.0+. 

This piece of code is legal in Visual C++:

	return epi::error_c(ERROR_INTERNAL);

but needs to be modified to this for Dev C++ (GCC 3.2):

	epi::error_c err(ERROR_INTERNAL);
	return err;

The application would need to work with directories: creation, deletion, reading, 
detection of and the getting and setting of the current directory. None of this 
functionality existed in the epi, but has now been added in the following 
funcs:

	bool GetCurrDir(const char *dir, unsigned int bufsize); 
	bool SetCurrDir(const char *dir);
	bool IsDir(const char *dir);
	bool MakeDir(const char *dir);
	bool RemoveDir(const char *dir);
	bool ReadDir(filesystem_dir_c *fsd, const char *dir, const char *mask);

The readdir uses filesystem_dir_c class to hold an array of the
filesystem_direntry_s struct, which details the directory. The struct
is given in epifilesystem.h.

The application would also need to copy files about. Not normally a function that
used, usually a system call. This has been added to the EPI.

Sorted a problem with the GetAt() returning junk under Visual C++ since it intrepreted
the dereferencing the *this[idx] as an array of epi::string_c and the pointer position
instead of calling the operator[] on the epi::string_c.

Moved the crc and md5 code into the epi namespace.

The application would need to take two parameters, both of which would need to have
defaults depending on what version they were upgrading from and to. For the purposes of
speed it is assumed that we are upgrading from V1.27 to V1.28. The parameters taken
are "--config-dir=<value>" and "--edge-dir=<value>". --config-dir is where you want
you config data to go (which defaults to the home directory of the current user if one 
exists plus a system specific subdir) and --edge-dir is the current engine directory 
(This defaults to the current directory). The program will then copy the edge.cfg and 
any savegames into from the savegame subdir in --edge-dir to --config-dir. A version.dat
is written out to prevent accidently re-running and aid any further revisions of
the upgrader tool. This file has a crc value at the end to insure against dodgy files
being read.

Fixed the sliders/thermos on the options menu where they always used to go one movement 
off the end. Also looked into a problem to do with the +/- screensize change going out
of sync with the thermo in the options menu. It appears the two are using different
code and one function (M_ChangeScreenSize()) was only updated the one. The screenblocks
var was the one in question not being updated. 

DATE: 2004/03/18

Changed the home directories for the various platform we use. ".edge" is retained for
linux/MacOS, "Application Data/Edge" is used for windows. Obviously these subdirs
are only ever used if a HOME environment var exists.

Cemented the default resolution with a set of #defines in i_defs.h. The default
depth is now 16-bit to fix problems with OpenGL code failing to find an 8-bit res,
which is not supported anyway.  

DATE: 2004/02/29

Fixed the epimemorymanager, so that the new/delete functions are actually used(!). Added
additional code to monitor the level of memory that is actually used by the code. I'm
concerned that the overhead of the monitoring might slow the engine a bit much, but 
allocation/reallocation/freeing should not be done willy-nilly between frames. We
now have something that could adequately monitor the suitation. Hopefully, we
don't need to make the code thread-safe as this will result in preformance degradation.

DATE: 2004/02/21

Two bugs sorted. 1) Software mode windows were not being drawn under win32 in the correct 
position. I borrowed the code for positioning windows from the OpenGL version. Its a bit 
hacked, but it is soon going to be consigned to the cvs history soon, so I'm not concerned 
about that. It works. 2) Since the app starts minimised under windows, we won't be processing
the timer. This is a problem if the initial resolution cannot be set and the program will
go into an infinite loop (the delay before trying again is based of the system clock). My 
solution was to only allow a set number of loops on the initial tick: if the clock isn't
moving then the delay will only loop a set number of times. The issue is that is processor
speed dependant, but since it should only happen on startup I don't foresee it being a
problem.

Have had chance to play EDGE using the software renderer, I do think that it would be
something of a shame if we didn't introduce a mode in the GL renderer to emulate a few
of its oddities. I'm convinced that the GL renderer is indeed accurate, but the game of
Doom was written with inaccuracies of the software renderer. Lighting is a very good
example: the GL version just doesn't come across as dark enough. This darkness in
doom added a lot to the game. Its not massive, but it does need to be considered before 
the old renderer goes the way of the dodo. 

The home directory is now used where applicable for storing EDGE data. The '.edge' 
directory is create and all config files and savegames get loaded/saved to this if
it exists.

DATE: 2004/02/15

Bugfixing time. 

Rewrote I_GetModifiedTime() to use win32 api functions. The internals of this function 
are not supposed to be portable so I was happy enough to stick in something that just 
worked. The net result is that WAD modification dates are checked against their
GWA counterparts and said GWA files are updated if out of date. It should be noted that 
attempting to use the debugger (Visual C++) on a release mode is not wise since it 
confuses itself and then you in the process :(. (Bug# 827391).

Spent best part of the day toying with window sizing and behaviour. Had to rely on the 
favoured trick of starting in minimised mode and maximising to get focus. This resolves
an issue - on win2k at least - where nothing was being drawn to the fullscreen window. 
It appears that wglMakeCurrent() is only effective on an active window. Whether this 
works on Win9x remains to be seen.

Encountered a problem where resolution changes were causing the rendering of non-2d 
objects to stop. Tracked it down to code in the call once RGL_InitUnits() needing to
be called again. I implemented a RGL_SoftInitUnits() function which is called on
resolution changes (after RGL_SoftInit()). This is not normally an area I venture, so
Andrew [Apted] may what to tidy that in his own way.

Back to the window positioning. I've added code which works out an area in which the
EDGE window can be positioned and enforces the position if the old window position
ventures out of that area. 

Window sizing has finally been sorted. GetSystemMetrics() can return some incredibly 
useful numbers in regards to screen title, border and frame size. As a result we can
now give a exact window size without needed to resort to some hardcoded and guessed at
numbers. Only took me 3 years to find that! 8).

Its noteworthy that I've only hacked about with the OpenGL windowing (since this is the
problem) and have not had chance to sort the software mode in the same way.

Almost forgot: Prevented EDGE from having more than one instance of itself running
under win32 at the same time.

TODOs:
* Dragging engine window on the fly (Do we care?).
* Make sure software mode still works. Needed for V1.28 release.
* Resolution sorting and picklist checking.
* Windowed/Fullscreen on the fly (Needed?).

Managed to get a build of glEDGE under MinGW. Had a search on the net for a version of 
DirectX libs for MinGW and found a version for 8. Build and compiled OK and ran fine.

Fix an interested bug to do with order-of-execution. Savegames failed to load correctly 
under the VC.NET version (but did under the MinGW version). It appears that the load code 
for the save games was dependant on how the code was being generated. 

The following code:
	value = SV_GetShort() | (SV_GetShort() << 16);

...is assembled differently on GCC (MinGW/MacOS/Linux) than on Visual C++.
	
GCC does this:
	Calls SV_GetShort() and push result on stack
	Calls SV_GetShort(), bitshift 16 to the left and push result on stack
	OR top two values on the stack.
	
Visual C does the reverse:
	Calls SV_GetShort(), bitshift 16 to the left and push result on stack
	Calls SV_GetShort() and push result on stack
	OR top two values on the stack.
	 
Since SV_GetShort() is reading from a file, value is loaded with two very different 
results. Its hard to say which compiler is correct since the SV_GetShort() were
replaced with constants the result would be the same. Needs more investigation. However,
the following code forces the order of execution: 

	// -ACB- 2004/02/08 Force the order of execution; otherwise 
	// compiler optimisations may reverse the order of execution
	unsigned short s1 = SV_GetShort();
	unsigned short s2 = SV_GetShort();
	return s1 | (s2 << 16);

Hacked is some changes to make the berserker and automap last a level. Setting -1 as the
parameter for POWERUP_xxxxxx() will result in a level long benefit.

DATE: 2004/02/01

Sorted i_video.cpp to compile under C++. Since I only ever debugged using OpenGL I only just 
got around to the conversion. 

Fixed a bug where P_CheckAbsPosition() was checking the tm_I (try_move_info_s) before it was 
being set! Now checks the thing->flags directory.

Fixed the issue with monsters resurrecting into another. The resurrection code now checks 
_properly_ for objects standing in the way.

Hacked the armour code a bit since it was reducing the amount of armour I had when
picking up an armour suit.

DATE: 2004/01/30

Added an array_iterator_c class for the purposes of cycling through the contents of array_c, 
it is (probably) more efficent than incrementing an index var, calculating the position in the
array and then dereferencing the pointer. Never comfortable with friend class usage, but it is 
appropriate in this case.

Wrote the code for hooking/unhooking/calling the flushers in the flusher_list. Also embedded the 
object within the mem_manager_c class itself.

DATE: 2004/01/09

Started building in the mem_manager_c class. The problem for me was not the coding 
itself, but had been the best way to implement the flushing facility. Anything that 
wishes to be flushed by the memory manager needs to be derived from the mem_flusher_c 
class andthen register itself with the memory manager. The function Flush() needs to be
implemented by the class its derived from.

My preferred name for getting an entry from an array (epi::array_c) and stack (epi::stack_c)
had been GetObject(), but M$ have done some interested hacking to their GDI headers to support
ASCII and UNICODE versions. The net result is that GetObject() gets interpreted as GetObjectA()
and refuses to compile. GetObject() has since become FetchObject(). Its noteworthy that this
wasn't picked up by the EPI test since we didn't go the windows GUI routine and the 
"interesting hacking" would not of been picked up. Also I didn't usually include "epi.h"
in the epiarray.cpp and epistack.cpp files.  

You may have noticed that we've started using a namespace for the EPI (cunning name 'epi'). It
seems the tidiest way to break down the code. 

TODO's from this date:
* mem_manager_c to create/destroy 'flusher_list'
* mem_manager_c to handle artifical memory limit
* mem_manager_c to flush memory under low memory conditions as per old z_zone code

DATE: 2003/10/11

Completing writing the basic implementation of the epi_array_c and epi_stack_c classes.

Continued to trawl through the mass of warnings generated by compiling the code with C++
restrictions. Most are preformance warning where int values were being treated as boolean 
values and floats being assigned 'double' values (i.e. 1.0 is a double constant, where 
1.0f is the same value as a float constant).

DATE: 2003/05/20

After a short (eh-hum) break, back to the grind stone. Two major issues I need to resolve
before I can make any real progress with EDGE. 1) the ability to compile on a Win32
platform with remote debugging capabilities and 2) the completion of the EPI so that the 
development process may be speeded up. This will hopefully be quite relaxing for me,
since it will be a break from the meat-ball surgery (re: "M*A*S*H") of developing
in the games industry. Quick, clean and tidy - now there is an idealism that will be 
hard to achieve :). 

On point 1) I've managed add project files for VC.NET and clear out all the compile
errors caused by the FIELD_OFF() defines; however I haven't written the replacement
code for DDF and the savegame code; this is now in progress. Andrew Apted's desire
to see the parser code re-written will be fulfilled in this one I think. A bit of C++
will certainly help us here.

In regards to 2) The EPI will have to be a gradual change - the only addition that
will be required first will be memory management.

Quick shout out to the developers of Tortoise CVS (www.tortoisecvs.org). Makes for
an excellent interface for CVS under windows. I use sourcesafe and alienbrain at work
and have to say CVS with Tortoise CVS is a dream to work with (plus you don't have the
exclusive checkout issues to worry about 8).

I've also had chance to play with makefiles for GCC on the linux version so that
all the lib makefiles are called by the 'edge' makefile. The makefile has been
moved to root of the codebase. 

Fore-I-forget, I've received a patch to the SDL code to build under MacOS 
X for the afore-mentioned Mr Apted (some people can't stay away 8). I will 
apply this when I've built the EPI up.

DATE: 2002/09/08

Implemented some EPI (EDGE Programming Interface) base classes. EPI was originally an idea 
developed by Erik Sandberg. The system interface code (all files beginning with i_) handled
everything specific to each platform, but there were no generic libraries. The EPI was to 
solved this problem. To aid in the more rapid development of EDGE I have developed my only 
simple base classes for that very purpose. I'm only planning to use the very basics of
C++ classes. All templates, multiple inheritance and STL will be avoided like the
plague if possible.

It should be noted that this does _not_ mean EDGE will be converted to C++. This could 
happen, but it is _highly_ unlikely to happen. The original code (for the most part) does 
work fine and it would lose that aged-old feel in my opinion :).

DATE: 2002/04/29

ReadScreen() implemented in software and GL Modes. This VCTX function is
now used by the m_misc functions to do with screen shots.

DATE: 2002/01/01

Took a fine tooth comb to the source code, so it will compile under C++. Not having 
had the opportunity to work on EDGE for a while, I've had to drop everything 
previous and go back to it once this has been finished. 

DATE: 2001/06/15

Back to back days of development on EDGE - I class this as an achievement
:). Made the I_GetModifiedTime function a bit more robust. I've made use 
of the new function by testing the modification time of the GWA against
that of the WAD. If the GWA file is older than the WAD file then EDGE will
rebuild the GWA. The engine will not load in the GWA, which means when the
playsim starts its initialisation it will build the GWA file. This is
really useful in my opinion.

DATE: 2001/06/14

Implemented I_GetModifiedTime() on Linux. I've added the prototypes to all
the other ports, but I have been unable to test them.

DATE: 2001/05/21

Another break from EDGE. All I_WriteDebug() calls have been
renamed to L_WriteDebug() and the define has also been removed. Time to
get back into the flow.

DATE: 2001/03/25

Elevator movement has moved forward, P_ChangeSector() is now aware of other 
extrafloor sectors, although it takes no account on liquid types.

The DDF for Elevators is very much in the same way as floors although the
ELEVATOR.DEST_REF does fully function yet (the settings are hard-coded at present,
the start is always considered to be the sector->ceil.h and the destination is 
set to 192). This is my current test DDF config:

[440] // EDGE ELEVATOR BASIC
TYPE=PUSH;
ACTIVATORS=PLAYER;
ELEVATOR.TYPE=MOVE;
ELEVATOR.SPEED_DOWN=1;
ELEVATOR.SPEED_UP=1;
ELEVATOR.SFX_DOWN=STNMOV;
ELEVATOR.SFX_UP=STNMOV;

The work that has been done so far uses the new linkages I have put in place. I'm
not happy with keeping up two different methods for linking
extrafloors to sectors. I think that I'll eventually remove one of the
systems or combine the two. The current method is very much designed around the
rendering aspect of the engine and seems to be over-complex for the playsim.

DATE: 2001/03/19

Added in the linkages between sectors and their extrafloors. The current code 
doesn't have link between a controller sector and the sector it provides an 
extrafloor for; certainly not one that doesn't involve going round the houses for 
anyway.

I'm a pleased to announce a working elevator. It moves up correctly and thats 
about it. All we have to do now is make it account for the rest of the playsim, 
move down and fit the specs are the current plane movements.

DATE: 2001/02/25

Fixed the stupid error with OpenGL. The window was not properly adjusted
to the right in the size on Win32.

DATE: 2001/02/18

Fixed the corrupt L_MP3.C on the CVS and recovering from a nuked hard disk.

DATE: 2001/02/09

Note to self: Use L_CovertToDB() for Win32 sound code.

Continued to work through the whole of p_plane.c. The playsim needs a bit of
tiding and I will do that as part of my elevator work. The thing here is that
this needs to be done in order to a) pick the overall design and b) improve
and optimise.

DATE: 2001/02/08

Did an overhaul of p_plane.c: I decided that all moving sectors should be
named more correctly as moving planes. I used the generic moving type to
create a linked list of all moving parts (planes, elevators & sliders), this
move may be reversed as its not as efficent in terms of speed. My aim here is
to make a cleaner codebase for the elevator code. I've going to hack in some
test data (myself and Andrew have agreed that code linking extrafloor
sectors and their parents needs reworking). I have prepared a demo level and
the test DDF's are complete.

DATE: 2001/02/05

ITs so going to be one of those weeks. Had to upload a bugfix to the
CVS source so it would COMPILE :(.

DATE: 2001/02/04

Before a use the classes, I want to have a working elevator. I've been working on the
bits and committing the changes I've certain of. Moved DDF_GetSectHeightReference() into
p_plane.c and made an internal routine. Its not used anywhere else and I can't see any
reason as to why it should be a function like DDF_GetLanguageReference().

I've been looking into the networking angle: one benefit of having a nice linux box, is 
that you can play about with networking without having to continuely restart the machine. 
Linux network code is not simple, but you can be sure that its not going to fall over for 
silly reasons.

DATE: 2001/01/29

Moved the 'specialdata' into the plane_info_t. I can clearly recall the
doom code being listed as compiling with ANSI C with classes, so I integrated
this into my design for specialdata. The basic structing involves a moving
type (MDT_) with next and previous pointers. This will mean that we can use
a single looping routine for each of the moving data. Think its better than
the specialdata thing.

Must remember to check that '-warp' parameter bug.

DATE: 2001/01/28

Fixed the small issue in regards to DirectX and weird unknown
crashes either when returning from a function (in Andrew's Case) and
doing the Z_Resize() of columnofs in r_main.c (in my case). This was a very
hard to locate bug I managed to create mixing up IID_DirectDraw &
I_IIDirectDraw2. The differences between the original and V2 interface
appeared to be causing the crash. I double-checked and made
sure we were using DirectX 7 versions in all said cases. I have to check with
Andrew before I can confirm this as a fix. Going to look at the '-warp' bug,
seems to be a memory leak, but I've got to look further into this one. My
next task is to move the 'void* specialdata' in plane_info_t, but I'm still
thinking hwo to use elevators here.

Added the ANDYTEMPFIX #define to the makefile, so the sound will work until
Andrew has completed his precent_t changes. I was panicing because I thought
that in attempting to fix the above problem I'd buggered the sound!

Added the MINILZO files to the Win32 Makefile. 

DATE: 2001/01/15

Implemented the 'i_music_info_t' structure thats been lying about in
I_SYSTEM.H for quite a while. I think we incorpate type into this
structure as well. I've modified all the system files related and tested
them all (except BeOS) they all compiled. Any old excuse to bugger up
all the platform-specific code :). I've tested the MP3, MUS & CD for
Win32. One thing I have noticed is that there appears to be a bug in the
sound code - which is highlight by entering a level and then running
"IDKILLALL" cheat. 

DATE: 2001/01/14

Worked on the build up to elevator code. Continued on the framework: I've
added in the functions and structures for the playsim setup. 

DATE: 2001/01/11

Decided to restart my work on two fronts; one is the DDF to editor config
file converter and the elevator code. I started by committing the ddf2edit
to the tools directory on CVS. The second front is the elevator code which
had been slowly gathering dust: not a good thing for any bit of code. There
was talk of renaming sector movements to plane due to the naming confusion
that would be huge with the addition of a moving_sector. Instead I choose to
call the moving_sector to elevator_sector. I've removed the ELEVATOR #defines
so that any dev bugs won't be hidden by enabling/disabling the #define.
I don''t think that the elevator code will be too hard to implement.

DATE: 2001/01/10

Seems the problem for linedef #10 is not DDF related. The code doesn't seem to
activate a sectors sfxstart on satrtup, only on manual movements and changing
direction. Fixed the EXE and removed a shedload of debugging notes. Added
the code into P_SetupSectorAction(). Its in here, because the code checks
whether or not movement should start.

DATE: 2001/01/09

Filled in the gaps for the sound looping code. I've done everything for
engine code, plus the system specifics DJGPP and WIN32. I had originally
thought that the Win32 code wouldn't be too hard to do, then I realised
that Microsoft didn't put a little function in to start/stop looping a sound
channel. The issue here is that I simply assume to much. The problematic
thing here is that Microsoft also managed to completely dump the DirectX
docs for V7 (EDGE's perferred version) and hike up V8, which happens to have
a different interface. This is gatesy way of forcable moving people on, but
leaves me with a problem in relation to documentation. Anyhow, after
looking into IDirectSoundNotify I was beginning to get a little worried: this
required going into CreateEvent() and windows idea on multi-threaded
code. This COM interface is used to call code when a sound buffer has reached
a certain point; Not for the faint of heart. I took the simplier route of
stopping and restarting the sound without the looping flag. Since Linux and
DJGPP have a simple approach I felt that the simple approach here. It worked
surprising well - maybe we didn't need to notify interface after all - but
it needs testing. I would if the SB PCI will give me grief here?

Going back to the actual code I've added a system specific function and
two platform functions:

bool I_SoundStopLooping(unsigned int chanid); // Stop channel looping
void S_StopLoopingSound(mobj_t *origin);    // Same format as S_StopSound
void S_StopLoopingChannel(int cnum);        // Same format as S_StopChannel

S_StartSound() used to kill sounds S_StopSound, now it uses
S_StopLoopingSound() and is a temp solution to the plane sound code problem.

DATE: 2001/01/08

Added prototypes for stopping a sound looping. The need for this has come
about because the plane code is causes sounds to stop permaturely on
platforms. The problem has been existance for sometime, probably dates back
to the DDF-ing of linedefs. 

DATE: 2001/01/07

Removed the short buffer code from I_SOUND.C. It seems there were some issues
arising from SoundBlaster PCI Cards. It seems that every-other card works fine
with the exception of a Creative Labs product, no change there then. Maybe
thats a little unfair, Creative tend do a really good job normally, but they
tend to tweak too much and cause little bugs like this. Apparently Aliens V
Predator has a similar problem. I can't really see what the problem was
accurately because I've never owned an SB PCI Card, but creating and
destroying sound buffers after use seems to solve the problem. Had I more time
I would be _much_ more through on finding a solution.

DATE: 2000/11/20

Contrary to popular belief, I still exist and have just fixed a minor issue
with Win32's I_Video.c. I think it might be better to under hard-code the
window and fullscreen code, the aim being to allow it to be switchable.

DATE: 2000/10/01

The editor config writer is working very well. I have think of a good
description system for linedefs. The system writes a very good Doom2.ini
for DOOMCad, but I still need to write one of WADAuthor and Yadex. I also
need to update for the latest version of DDF.

Continued implementing elevator code. I'm continuing to plan my changes as
I don't want to hack this in and also I need to clean the existing code.

DATE: 2000/09/05

Decided to best way for a converted was to take the existing parser out of
EDGE will all its necessary baggage, it was either this or build a new one,
which I'm not keen since the DDF Parser is a complex beast. The ripped out
code works OK, once I hack together a system file, implemented the necessary
maths files and created a ddf_type.h to hold all the #defines and structs
not handled by ddf_main.h.

Began work on elevator code. It currently is possible to create a elevator
using an extra floor, but it is very messy and doesn't work well. Faced with
the option on linking floor and ceiling, I ran a mile: this would be
extremely bad coding and confuse the fuck out of everyone including myself.
Instead I choose to create an elevator type which will handle this element
of the code and won't mean hacking the plane movement code to death.

Concerned about the way ceilings and floors are handling in structures,
currently that are stored as a struct within a struct, which means they
take up space, when not is use - wasting memory. I think that we should
setup pointers to data structs instead as this would be better memory wise
and wouldn;t look nearly as bad.

Added the music info struct to i_system.h. If I know its there I'll do
something about implementing it :).

Tied a few issues with function naming and commenting. I can read code that
looks all the same....

DATE: 2000/09/02

Working on converting DDF to editor config files. I've been lucky enough
to get access to a decent linux server through my "dumb" (quite literally)
winterm and can work on conversion.

Fixed all the DDF Headers from "Doom" to "EDGE Data". EDGE is not Doom.

DATE: 2000/08/23

The common MP3 lib code (l_mp3.c & l_mp3.h) had a small bug it in it - 
the ring buffer read & write positions were not set at any time. This proved
to be a problem when closing from one MP3 to another. The L_MP3SetMusicFile()
function now sets them equal to each others (means ring buffer is empty).

Fixed a problem where some MP3's were causing bad sync errors. These bad
sync errors were being caused at the end of some MP3 - I believ they acted 
as termination and therefore DecodeIntoRingBuffer() returns zero
on this error, which causes EDGE to stop the playing MP3. As kester used
to say - errors suck.

Modified the EDGE code so that any MP3 type entry has to be file-only and 
the filename - as opposed to the file data - is passed to the EPI. The
Win32 code now supports MP3 (thanks to the guys behind XINGMP3 and Andrew
Apted common lib code which works a treat): the output is 8-bit 11025Hz 
Stereo regardless of the MP3 settings itself - the lib code does any
necessary conversion. MP3 is essentially a compressed WAV format and
therefore access to the sound effects system is required. The
DirectSound object for sounds is needed to create a secondary buffer
and process the wave data from the lib - I've also managed to get round
my serious problem getting a streaming buffer to work and I didn't do
anything new....

Working on my GUI code some more. One thing I can say for Micro$oft is 
that they stick to one method, but once you get use to the methods used
its not too bad, although it could be better.
 
Nevertheless, I have produced a set of handlers that will hopefully make 
creating GUI objects easier and hopefully make it cross-platform also, My 
first target will be X. The code is basic at present, but it will extended 
to cover a few advanced features. 

IN_A_WINDOW #define added. This will force EDGE for Win32 to use a window
as opposed to using the whole screen. The code has been tested and the 
depth of the screen will be changed if the EDGE depth is different to the
screen depth.

Reworked the sound vol & pan functions: Due to the fact that M$ have said
that the panning and volume ranges are subject to change, I have
re-written code to convert EDGE panning and volume ranges to their
M$ counterparts. Still had to compensate for the fact that below
50% is not/barely (delete as required) audible to the human ear.

DATE: 2000/08/13

Working on the tools for EDGE, more than the engine itself. I've worked
on producing simple tools ans also front ends. Have added the DDFinWAD tool
to CVS which allows integration of DDFs into WADs. Too much for such a short
period of time :).

DATE: 2000/07/22

Found a bug in the MUS Code - it didn't exit from pause properly because
it wasn't told to resume. Worked on getting EDGE to run in a window on
WIN32.

DATE: 2000/07/20

Fixed a problem with '-infight' and changing levels. It was crashing because
the 'targetmobj' was still pointing the freed data. I simplified the routine
and removed some code that was now irrelvant.

DATE: 2000/07/17

Finally got the MUS Code just right. Next on the TODO List - ALT+TABing
and getting it to work without weird effects.

DATE: 2000/07/11

Found the annoying little bug in the WIN32 MUS Code: The pitchwheel was not
correctly been handled. I could detect that certain notes were not been
playing properly and turned some of the great music into sheer pants. I did
not include the MUS Code in the release for two reasons - one being the bug
and the other being that at that time there was no MUS Support in DJGPP.
Now all three main platforms (DJGPP/WIN32/LINUX) support MUS to a decent
level I'm happy. I doubt the MP3 Code is going to be so easy to implement.
The main plan is that we will produce some generic code that handles the
decoding process, which will give a second of sound to stream and this will
be passed to whatever sound system is running. How viable this is will remain
to be seen, but I feel that using a library to support would be a dis-service
to people who would want learn from our code. Besides we only need something
relatively simple.

The only thing that does need to be done is to make the MUS code for DJGPP
and Win32 look similar. Since I took code for several places to create them,
it doesn't look good at all, the basic implementation of both is the same
and I hope that people can understand how they work.

DATE: 2000/07/10

Re-implemented the MUS Code for DJGPP. The first rule of allegro programming
with interrupts is LOCK_FUNCTION(). Worked on supporting OpenGL in a window
for Win32. I've also added a resource file for Win32, it currently holds a
file menu with a very hacked exit routine. I'm going to playing around this
to implement front-ends for tools for EDGE.

DATE: 2000/07/08

I have been working on porting the original MUS Code so that it works under
the current system, should be quick and easy.

Tweaked around with Win32 some more. A few minor issues have now been
resolved (not being able to click the fatal error dialog box for one).

DATE: 2000/07/05

Fixed a minor issue with BCC's Makefile - it didn't think it was compiling a
windows application, but working anyway - oops. This is the reason it was
starting up in command prompt. Fixed a problem with STANDARDVGAMODES and NT,
quite simply the two don't match so it was removed from the DirectDraw
creation code.

Have been preparing some work for a basic setup program in EDGE. I've been
working on the Win32 API to produce a front-end for glBSP also.

Looked at the EDGE V1.00 Code to reconstruct the MUS Code for DJGPP.

DATE: 2000/07/04

Fixed a few issues with the Win32 Console not updating correctly when
alt-tabbing in and out of EDGE, also the cursor is no longer shown on
re-entry. Fixed a problem with the automap code not compiling without
DEBUG_TRUEBSP.

DATE: 2000/06/26

Fixed a few issues with compilation of the new OpenGL code that Andrew
Apted has been working with. It would appear that BCC has a different
intepretation of #if then most compilers. I have replaced all occurences
of #if with #ifdef.

DATE: 2000/06/25

Using the new timer that Win32 has I have added buffered input from the
DirectInput devices. Its now easier to play in higher resolutions.

DATE: 2000/06/18

Disabled MUS Music for release. I've founf that run-time convertion is poor,
I will continue work on the MUS->MIDI Conversion.

DATE: 2000/06/09

Updated the README.BCC file.

DATE: 2000/06/08

Tweaked the WIN32 Console to scroll properly. Fixed a problem within the argument code that
was going to cause no end of problems. The current code takes a pointer to the argument string,
which might work fine under LINUX and DJGPP, but doesn't under WIN32.

Added E_EngineShutdown() which is called by I_SystemShutdown() on a shutdown. I think this is
somewhat backward, but I_System.C is probably the only file that should interact with the
platform code.

Fixed numerous BCC Warnings and an issue with all the IWADs being loaded E_MAIN.C - which for 
some reasons gets fixed and broken every six months.

Fixed a problem with a subtle memory overright problem which turned up with
my changes to M_ARGV.C. It was panicing me, but somehow I managed to
unearth the little bug that set the turbo-scale to -171726353. Suffice to say it
took me two hours to find the little bugger.

DATE: 2000/06/07

Removed the engine-specific code from DJGPP's Music Code.

DATE: 2000/06/06

It appears that the midiout volume code is only relative to the main
volume setting in windows. I must start work on the code to alter the
main volume settings.

Playlist entries now specify the information format properly, as opposed to
assuming by the music type what we info we are reading. I_MusicPlayback()
now receives a data pointer in the case of lumps and files.

DATE: 2000/06/05

For some reason that I don't fully understand the new timer calls for
Win32 EDGE seems to fail at random. I tried starting the timer before
any other calls in I_SystemStartup() and killed it last in
I_SystemShutdown(). This seems to have solved the problem and since I
now know how to get Win32 to call a function interrupt-style, I implemented
a tic counter which is now returned in I_GetTime() - same way as DJGPP.

Fixed BCC Compiler Warnings. If you ever used Borland's C compiler, you'll
know it warns you about more little bits and pieces that really can make a
hash of a great piece of code.

DirectInput code has been fixed so that any failure to acquire the keyboard
or the mouse if not fatal. This allows for ALT+TABing out of EDGE.

DATE: 2000/06/04

Fixed numerous warning errors under BCC. I've rigged up MUS MUSIC support
under Win32. To the ear its not brillant, but that may have more with my
music drivers under Win32 than anything else. I'm going to see what
tweaking I can do to improve the situation AFTER I've got new drivers.

Modified the default config in M_MISC.C, they don't set any of the keys. This
may seem daft, but it means that if uses deliberately don't assign an action,
the action remains un-assigned. This does mean that a default config file
should need to be released with each binary to set defaults. 

DATE: 2000/04/21

Fixed a few outstanding issues with the CD Player in windows. It now does
repeat play if set to loop.

Today I also worked on a the MUS->MIDI converter for DJGPP and WIN32.

DATE: 2000/04/18

Added the DirectInput checking for the CAPSLOCK key.

DATE: 2000/04/17

Added I_PathIsDirectory() to the EPI. This is because Win32 does not support
access() with the D_OK parameter. This fixes the problem with IWAD's and
Win32.

DATE: 2000/02/26

Started working on changing WIN32 compilers from MSVC to BCC. This
change is
in part due to Borland's Decision to release its compiler free and in part
due to the fact that MSVC doesn't implement optimisation in its standard
version.

DATE: 2000/02/19

Implement DirectMusic. I am annoyed by the fact that it appears that the
microsoft in-ability to go the extra mile and support basic features on
current devices exists in DirectMusic. It plays OK, but I cannot give any
volume control. FILE: I_DIGMID.C.

Added I_UnloadSfx() and modified I_LoadSfx() for the new sound caching
by Erik.

Added I_CONWIN.C which gives a new output window for the console as
opposed to the old default console window which looked like an MSDOS
prompt. Its not a brillant terminal window as it doesn't support any
codes apart from carriage return ('\n').

Unable to track some malloc problems that occured the yesterday, the
crashes where fairly random, but all showed up in the system interface
code of both WIN32 and DJGPP. I don't think we have seen the last of
that problem.

Polished the Sound interface code for WIN32 a bit and did a limited
reworking of the DJGPP sound code to output errors to the errordesc if
needed. Also the channel control system does not use the allegro handle
for reference directly any more. Seems to be rock solid currently.

Written M_CheckExtension() in M_MISC.C. This is a little function that
compares an extension with a filename and returns information regarding
the comparision.

The Function Prototype is:
exttype_e M_CheckExtension(const char* ext, const char* filename);

The const char* ext is a string with a minimum of 1 character and a
maximum of 3 - all alphanumeric characters.

The const char* filename is a string containing the filename.

The return type of exttype_e is as follows:
  EXT_WEIRD       - either filename or ext is invalid.
  EXT_NONE        - filename has no extension.
  EXT_NOTMATCHING - filename has a non-matching extension.
  EXT_MATCHING    - filename has a matching extension.

Using the above procedure, the EDGE engine will detect WAD extensions
and add one if none exists.

Had to re-jig my WIN32 OpenGL code to actually get it to work. The
problem that was to keep the screen copy functions working, although
they are not currently needed it is impossible to remove them as coping
goes on. The Doom Renderer that the EDGE engine uses was never designed
to be modular. However after coding the work around and the code renders
nicely. Andrew Apted's TrueBSP renderer (which is in development) is well
suited to OpenGL rendering and it produces a nice green and red world
(texturing is due soon).

More WIN32 work: The DirectSound class I was working on has been completed
and I have turned the class in a C module. The C++ code had a few bugs
in it that were not found until the extreme testing done under the
EDGE engine. I have fixed the small glitches and we now have a fully
functional sound system under WIN32 (no more problems with looping and
long sounds). The system is simple create and maintain small length
buffers which deal with short sounds. Create and dispose of buffers for
long and looping sounds. Since most EDGE effects are short and played
only once, it means that It does not have to keep creating small buffers
for no reason. I did not choose to stream audio as I thought that just
creating and destroying would be simplier and less prone to problems on
less-than ideal spec machines. I hope to pull together a good C Module
and C++ class to distrube for people who what simple sound in WIN32.

Another month, another new set of sound prototypes:

bool I_StartupSound(void* sysinfo);
int I_LoadSfx(unsigned char *data, unsigned int length, unsigned int freq);
int I_SoundPlayback(unsigned int soundid, int pan, int vol, bool looping);
bool I_SoundAlter(unsigned int chanid, int pan, int vol);
bool I_SoundCheck(unsigned int chanid);
bool I_SoundPause(unsigned int chanid);
bool I_SoundResume(unsigned int chanid);
bool I_SoundKill(unsigned int chanid);
void I_SoundTicker(void);
void I_ShutdownSound(void);
char* I_SoundReturnError(void);

With the exception of shutting down and the tick function, all functions
return something: All bool returns are true on success, false on
failure. All int returns are -1 on failure (assume success otherwise). The
new addition to the pack is I_SoundReturnError which returns an error
string or an empty string on no error. Once the procedure is call the
error stored is clears, calling it once again will just return the empty
string. This is set if any of the functions return failure. The void*
parameter is set for system specific information.

DATE: 1999/12/04

Worked on DirectSound and CD-Audio Class. This will become part of a
library I intend on building for both test utilities and EDGE itself. The
CD-Audio is itself complete, but I am working on a better DirectSound
Class.

Converted my log into HTML. This is so easy. Web-designers have an easy
life :).

DATE: 1999/11/24

Written the MIDI handling for DJGPP. I've tested the file handling system
to check it works OK, I still need to go over the lump handling (due to
fact it requires a function to load into the allegro MIDI structure).

I fixed the DDF Parser to deal with unknown control characters and
directory seperators. An unknown control character is treated as the
character without the backslash. So '\t' is treated as 't'. This was
implemented as '\' used to ignore everything if a non-valid control
character was found.

Directory seperation characters are now defined by the double backslash
('\\') in DDF. This allows for DDF files to be portbale as well due to the
fact that different operating systems use different directory seperators.

DATE: 1999/11/15

MAXINT is DJGPP specific! Use INT_MAX which is ANSI standard C and is
usable by all. I like portable code.

DATE: 1999/11/13

Completed the DJGPP CD Interface and the DJGPP system interface. My real
concern is that file IO fails when the CD interface is up and running. As
a result the saving of the config file is left to the moment prior to
closing the debug file. I will feel comfortable when this has minor
problem has been removed.

I renamed the music functions (as requested by -AJA-) to mirror their
sound counterparts. The Music API is now:

void I_StartupMusic(void);
void I_SetMusicVolume(int* handle, int volume);
int I_MusicPlayback(char* strdata, int type, bool file, bool looping);
void I_MusicPause(int* handle);
void I_MusicResume(int* handle);
void I_MusicKill(int* handle);
void I_MusicTicker(int* handle);
void I_ShutdownMusic(void);

to match the sound with:

void I_StartupSound(void);
int I_SoundPlayback(int soundid, int pan, int vol, bool looping);
void I_SoundPause(int channel);
void I_SoundResume(int channel);
void I_SoundKill(int channel);
void I_SoundTicker(void);
void I_ShutdownSound(void);
void I_LoadSfx(int soundid, void *data, int length, int freq);
void I_SoundAlter(int channel, int pan, int vol);
bool I_SoundCheck(int channel);

A few of the sound API have been renamed to mirror the music API, there
have been small changes.

The music API requires a pointer to the handle for some of the calls,
because it is one good way of indicating failure: a handle of -1 is
treated as a non-used music handle. The music handle is otherwise not
used by the EDGE main code.

Without a working copy of MSVC currently I have been unable to bring the
CD Music code upto scratch on that. The MCI CD handler with all need to
have the mixer properties available: It is not possible to control the
volume via the MCI.

Added DDF_MUS.C. This code deals with the playlist requirements, in
terms of DDF files it is the most simple.

DDF Playlist Descriptor:
[<Entry-no>] MUSICINFO=<format>:<info-format>:<reference>;

The entry number is used by other DDF's to reference a music entry;
The format can be CD, MIDI, MP3 or MUS; The information format can be
FILE or LUMP. FILE means that it will be referencing an external file,
LUMP means a data chunk in the wad file. This is ignored for CD Type
(although it does need to a valid entry). One idea for the future is
STREAM, which could be an audio stream feed via a local intranet or the
internet; Reference is a string used for reference in obtaining the
music, for CD's this is a track number. Otherwise, when the is FILE,
its a filename, when the is LUMP, its the lumpname.

Adding the playlist does demonstrate the need to me for further
generalisation as some entries removed can only be fixed by the addition
of GAME.DDF.

S_Start has been renamed to S_SoundLevelInit() as it is more descriptive,
S_StopMusic is explicitly called by I_Shutdown to stop the music. This
was lacking as previously it was assumed that all audio was stopped by
the system interface code: BCD does not stop CD Audio on exit.

S_Ticker() has been renamed to S_SoundTicker() with the addition of a
new S_MusicTicker(). Isn't this going somewhat crazy on procedures? Not
really, it is important that the S_SoundTicker is called often as it
maintains the smooth running of the sound effects system: S_MusicTicker
does not need to be called anywhere near as much.

The music cheat will be reimplemented soon.

DATE: 1999/11/09

Used the BCD library as a basis for creating EDGE DJGPP's CD Audio
Interface, since it was based heavily on BCD, all functions have a BCD_
prefix.

DATE: 1999/11/07

Wrote an OpenGL interface for WIN32. Will start testing as soon as my
MSVC CD is replaced. I concerned because the renderers should now be
seperated and this is going to cause no end of problems if bot dealt with.

DATE: 1999/11/06

Back to the grind stone after some intensive other work. Fixed the
zero-based array problem in ddf_sfx.c. Tested the concept of using
Borland C++ Builder 3, problems occuring due to use of pure C++ compiler.

DATE: 1999/10/20 -> 1999/10/22

Tested a method of reducing the length of code in e_main.c and to kill
the code in startup for WIN32. I settle on getting all the functions to
return bool depending on if they succeeded without error. The next
step was to loop through the functions and exit on failure. I've done
75% of the calls in E_EDGEMain() like this, but I need to make sure that
the functions themselves do return true or false correctly.

MIDI->MUS conversion outline code has been added in a new S_UTIL.C
file. This will be a useful place for code that is not system specific
for both sound & music.

DATE: 1999/10/16 -> 1999/10/19

Fixed the pausing sound problem. S_PauseSounds() pauses all playing
sounds, S_ResumeSounds() resumes all paused sounds. This has required
to additional functions to be added to the EDGE Sound System API:
I_PauseSound() and I_ResumeSound() have been added and do exactly what
they say on the box. This is a slight enhancement on the old system when
pausing, which killed all playing sounds.

Added I_HandleKeypress to the WIN32 I_CTRL.C, this deals with keys
that are caught by the message loop and NOT DirectInput. For some
reason DirectX does not handle certain keys well and the PAUSE key is
of them. Its important you check that the message loop is not handing
you a key that has been held down.

This is what

 if ((lParam & 0x40000000) != 0)
   break;

is responsible for in the I_WindowProc() switch (case WM_KEYDOWN) is for.

Tweaked the volume control in WIN32. 50% DirectSound Volume = 1% Allegro
Volume. So no-one is playing with an advantage, I adjusted the volume
handler in WIN32 I_Sound.C to compensate.

The Pan/Seperation calculation is WIN32 I_SOUND.C is now a #define.

DATE: 1999/10/15

Fixed the looping problem in DJGPP. I let allegro deal with it, the
timing system was not accurate enough and caused a few problems. The
sound is only killed now if the sound is not looping. The playmode for
looping sounds is logically PLAYMODE_LOOP and non-looping PLAYMODE_PLAY.

DATE: 1999/10/13

Wrote a screen shot routine, it uses a new function for obtaining the
an RGB value from the current palette (if in 8-bit colour). The routine
in V_COLOUR (V_IndexColourToRGB) is needed because TGA format uses RGB
Values. TGA was choosen because I had used it in previous OpenGL coding
work. TGA uses 24-bit colour with the Red and Blue swapped, the lines
are also stored bottom to top. I will add in a PCX format screenshot at
some stage, because I did not have time to work out PCX at present.

Fixed a problem in E_SetGlobalVars where setting were being overriden
here, where that had been already setup in the config file. I now
check that the settings have not been set and then check if a parameter
sets them.

I have been building a MUS to MIDI converter. The formats are very similar
with the exception of the way multiply channels are handled. MIDI has
a track for each channel, MUS has a single stream of information that
tells what channel it is referring to and then what to do. Once I have
written this, I will be able to implement MIDI and MUS support in one go.

DATE: 1999/10/11

Now everyone repeat after me: LOCKING MEMORY IN ALLEGRO IS VERY
IMPORTANT. I could not for the life of me understand why the sounds in
my DJGPP version were giving so much grief. I had somehow omitted to lock
the memory that my hack-loaded samples was using: A quick point-in-fact,
Allegro like most other libraries do not allow you to load raw data into
a sound. Having fixed this little problem. I had the effects working as
well - if not better - than my Win32 version.

Another problem cropped up with I did not expect: allegro seems to have
real difficultly in de-allocation of voices after they have finished
playing. I had a little blast of E1M1 and the system was running short of
sounds. I instituded by use of getting a time (in tics) of when a sound
should finish and freeing it manually: this is why having I_UpdateSound()
is useful. It really should not be used in Allegro/DJGPP, but comes
in useful.

I continued to debug the Win32 sound code. So far, I seems to have
worked around the problem of sounds repeating: Its not perfect and I'm
not happy with it, but it has cured the most of the problem. I set the
buffer position to zero when I_SoundKill clears the sound. I think it has
to do with DirectX and its inability to stop a buffer playing fast enough.

I now have to finish work on streaming sounds longer than the buffers
in Win32/DirectX and set the frequency of the buffers on playback. I
had for some reason thought that buffer frequencies were fixed (?).

DATE: 1999/10/09

I have for the last few days have been plagued by little sound problems. I
am now confident that I can play a decent sound in windows without random
noise interference. The problem is that locking an entire buffer for
even a split second causes noise, something not mentioned in the docs. I
did try having a static buffer for each sound which played with random
noise; however, since there is likely to more than one occurance of a
sound playing at anyone time and I did not want to bugger about with
duplicate buffers, I choose to return to using streaming buffers. The
trick here is to lock from the write cursor (DSBLOCK_FROMWRITECURSOR)
and write the sound effect after and before the buffer. How the Win32
sound system works now is having 16 continously looping buffers which
are blanked (value 128) when not used, but sound is written after the
write cursor the moment it is played. A time is TICS in kept when the
sound should be stopped. Remember DirectSound buffers are circluar.

Allegro sound will shortly be re-written. It seems to have real problems
when using voice controls, a lot of random noise occurs. Sometimes it
will be perfect, other times it will crash allegro. In theory it should
work, but does not. Fix this tommorrow.

DATE: 1999/10/06

Finished the system specific coding for the sound. The DJGPP/Allegro
version is simple enough, however I am not quite so sure about my
WIN32/DirectSound code. The DirectSound system is of prototype design,
as opposed to destroying and re-building sound buffers all the time:
something that may prove to be time consuming. So I took the approach
of allocating 16 sound buffers with enough memory to store 1 second of
8-bit 11025hz sound; if EDGE requires to play a sound longer than this,
the sound is streamed into the buffer after every half second of sound. I
will find out whether it will work properly when I finished the EDGE
sound code.

S_ResumeSound and S_PauseSound became S_ResumeMusic and S_PauseMusic,
respectively. This is all they do.

Created S_MUSIC.C: I moved all the music (non-system-specific) functions
into this file. Keeping It Simple, Stupid.

DATE: 1999/10/05

Actually added a call to E_SetGlobalVars() to E_EDGEMain(). I appear to
have forgotten to do this previously. Move a whole bunch of parameter
checks to this procedure.

Added a lot of the sound code to EDGE. I have concentrated on doing both
DJGPP and WIN32 version at the same time, procedure by procedure. I think
that once I have completed the system specific stuff I will move onto
the main code in general. I have removed the sound length calculation
from the system specific code - it should not be system specific.

I will complete this work tommorrow.

DATE: 1999/10/04

Altered the menu resolution selector to choose a calaculated list of
available resolutions. This system works from input from DirectDraw. I
am going to look into how this is possible for the DOS Version. I have
included 24-bit as a selection as this is planned. The menu selection
remember modes, not the width, height and bpp as before. I think that
altering all of EDGE's multires to use this is a good idea, but will
consult with Erik and Andrew first.

Spent last couple of days trying the track a re-alloc problem that was
causing a great deal of hassle for Marc Pullen's QDoom. It appears that
the re-allocation of memory fails to re-address global pointers. This
is major mistake.

DATE: 1999/10/01

WIN32 Version now supports hi-colour. I had to manually create the
MakeColour function that is part of the allegro library. I think I will
have to make it adjustable for other depths of colour as it currently
only supports a colour depth of 16-bits. In the future we will probably
expand into 24-bit colour and we will also have to support cards that
support 555 RGB values in 16-bit colour (as opposed to 565 RGB).

DATE: 1999/09/30

Found out why my WIN32 keyboard handler doesn't work: The timer only works
when other messages are not being sent. So that means all my keyboard
checking must happen once per tic. As opposed to the keyboardISR idea
I took from the DOS specific code. This is also why my I_GetTime code
failed. My inexperience with WIN32 is beginning to show, however I think
that learning the hard way helps.

With further examination of the main keyboard handling code and
what DirectInput was giving out. I realise quickly what needed
doing. DirectInput will only tell you when a key is pressed, not when
is pressed then released. In order to do that you keep a record of if
a key was recorded as being down on a previous tic. If a key is down,
but was reported as being down on a previous tic you don't post an event
stating that this key is down. If a key is up, check if last time round
it was recorded as being down then post an event stating that this key
is up. (WIN32 only).

I have also added two pre-calculated tables for the I_ScanCode2DoomCode
code, I feel there to be no need to have two big switch procedures,
when two tables will do. This is only in WIN32 currently.

Changed M_MISC.C read CFG files to store the KEYD code as opposed to
the system specific code. This means that EDGE for different platforms
can use the same config file.

As I am going to add WIN32 Mouse support. A fourth mouse button has
been added.

WIN32 Mouse support included.

DATE: 1999/09/29

Fixed the major error (in WIN32) that was holding the video code up: The
dummy screen was not being allocated not correct amount of memory. To rub
in the salt, I discounted this as a possibility early on :(. Incidently,
it wasn't one of the nuked warnings.

I_GetTime code is now based on the timeGetTime() WIN32 function as my
SetTimer() system of incrementing 'mselapsed' every tick failed.

Keyboard handling works well, with the exception of normal
keys. Eventually the system will stop responding to the keyboard
totally. For some reason the keyboard can not be aqcuired at all. I
going to investigate the problems bugging the WIN32 version.

DATE: 1999/09/28

Decided that since I can't trace the error in WIN32 very easily I will
have to nuke every warning that MSVC has given. 90% of MSVC warnings
can be ignored, but I think one is causing real problems.

Removed all the french keyboard rubbish in HU_STUFF.C. Its totally unused.

Added (char) cast before all the numbers in HU_STUFF.C shiftxform
table. This removes about 40 warnings at least.

Cleared up all the warning remaining that required castings. MSVC compiles
with 0 errors and 80 warnings. The remaining warnings are to do with the
procedure pointer handling by actionf_t. There is nothing I can do about
these. Its has however done nothing to kill off my function calling bug.

DATE: 1999/09/27

Added M_PI #define to I_Defs.H under WIN32. This is because there is no
define for it in MSVC.

Fixed some unary minus figure problems in R_MAIN.C. MSVC was compiling
that: 'unary minus operator applied to unsigned type, result still
unsigned'. The processing order for MSVC and DJGPP is clearly
different. In order to get a minus value from:

return -tantoangle[SlopeDiv(y,x)];

it needs changing to:

return (tantoangle[SlopeDiv(y,x)] * -1);

Had some major problems with Win32 video code. The compiler is reporting
problems with bad procedure casting, i.e the function was defined with
one calling style and used with another. This seems to result in the
main_scr width being set to 0, which causes an error. I'm obviously got
to take a long look at this. I know for a fact that main_scr->width is
set correctly to start off with, but I think the method of picking depth
routines is now in question.

DATE: 1999/09/25

Moved I_SYSTEM.H to the main source directory. It should not be different
between different systems.

Someone decided to set a boolean value to minus -1. Which kinda defeated
my workaround of setting boolean to an unsigned char. Strictly speaking
the value should only ever be 0 or 1. I tracked the problem down the
DDF_Anims Code. However, several attempts at a workaround seem to fail
for no apparent reason. The problem was that the endname (flat lump) was
not being set and some loops were never exiting. Due to time constraints
I changed all occurances of boolean to bool.

Working in creating a output window for before the switch into graphics
mode on Win32 apps. The reason for this is because the debug file seems to
stop writing long before exiting the program, so we need a form of output.

DATE: 1999/09/24

Add I_EDGELoop to the respective I_SYSTEM.C's and E_EDGELoopRoutine to
E_Main.C. Unlike DOS a lot of multi-tasking systems require to control a
program. The best example is Microsoft's pet project. I_EDGELoop calls
E_EDGELoopRoutine every time the program can run. For DOS this is one
infinite loop with no checking; For Win32 this is part of a message
handling loop. E_EDGELoop calls I_EDGELoop.

Due to some apparent laziness by Microsoft the boolean type gets defined
needlessly in some very obscure header file. As a result the boolean
definition is now moved from Dm_Type.H to I_Defs.H. typedef-ing boolean
as an unsigned char and #define-ing true as 1 and false as 0 works around
this problem. I had considered changing boolean to eboolean, but I will
wait until the discussion over EDGE typedefs has been completed.

I_Warning now prints to the console as well as the debug
file. Debug_Printf got nuked and replaced by I_WriteDebug Procedure.

Completed all the keyboard startup routines in I_CTRL.C in WIN32. I
will now go on to the video controls and hopefully get a basic version
up and running on completion.

Have completed I_Video Code, but have had several teething problems
with how errors are handled and how strncasecmp is actually supposed to
work. The code does return non-zero on error as it should, but does not
seem to be giving the correct value. The problem I have is that this value
is used in the sorting of strings which relys on the correct information.

I would like to at this point thank Bruce Lewis for his work on Windoom
and his assistance to me on my other projects. It had more than prepared
me for porting the EDGE engine, especially working with WIN32.

DATE: 1999/09/23

Replaced all occurance of malloc functions in CON_*.* with Z_Malloc
functions. Since we allocate a heap we might as well use it. Besides we
have control with Z_Malloc functions.

Z_Init is now called at the very start of E_EDGEMain so all functions
can use it.

Removed all I_Printf functions prior to CON_InitConsole.

Making my way through all the code replacing all the occurances of
malloc functions with their Z_Malloc counterparts. Removed the dreaded
alloca() also.

Fixed the defines in E_Search.H with Z_Malloc instead of the int
var[assumeval] code that is hampering my portability efforts.

Renamed the typename var of the cvar_enum_t to typenam. Lets not confuse
C++ keywords with identifiers.

Unconfused compiler in V_LoadColourmap: the function was adding to a void
pointer before being passed to a byte pointer. MSVC did not assume that
the pointer was being move in jumps of byte length. Therefore I had to
explicitly add (byte*) to force that assumption.

With the time at 9:26am got 2 errors and 489 warnings under MSVC.

Spent the rest of the day sorting out small errors that had been occured
by my extensive removal of non-portable functions and the introduction of
Z_Malloc. Finally got a MSVC with no errors. Now I can proceed tommorrow
with getting a functioning WIN32 version.

DATE: 1999/09/22

Removed all the parameter checks call in I_SYSTEM.C to
E_SetGlobalVars. There is nothing system specific about them and they
should operate on all platforms.

I_ShutdownControl is now called explicitly in I_ShutdownSystem and not
using the atexit() routine. I do not like the use of atexit() at the best
of times, due to the fact that we are leaving the system in charge. This
will also allow for the system to be shutdown and brought back up again
if it is ever found to be necessary.

Removed all the control shutdown code in I_ShutdownSystem to small
functions called by I_ShutdownControl.

Allegro Interrupt timer called without allowing for -noirq.

I_StartupGraphics removed for E_EDGELoop to I_SystemStartup.

Removed the clock checking code in I_GetTime. Interupts only. I personally
hope to limit us to the microtimer if enough CPU's support it.

I_Error calls I_ShutdownSystem to close system down now. The error is
no longer printed in the debug file.

I_INPUT.C got renamed to I_CTRL.C.

Removed KeyRepeatDelay and KeyRepeatRate for I_CTRL.C and I_SYSTEM.H,
they are now represented as #DEFINEs in CON_CON.C.

Moved I_StartFrame from E_EDGELoop to the beginning of E_Display. The
reason behind this for where a system needed to be told that a frame is
about to be rendered. OpenGL is one example.

For the record, my first MSVC compile got 2441 errors and 866 warnings.

inline statements removed. Incompatible with MSVC.

'long long' is to be replaced by Int64 typedef. GCC supports 'long long'
only, whereas MSVC supports _int64. Therefore the follow typedefs occur
int i_defs.h:

#ifdef DJGPP
typedef long long Int64;
#endif

#ifdef WIN32
typedef _int64 Int64;
#endif

I expect more to follow.

Also #defines with an argument type differ in MSVC and GCC, so therefore
all #defines are to be replaced by procedures.

Time currently 11:29am with 786 errors and 913 warnings under MSVC.

Left EDGE alone to return to do some work of the physical nature,
returned at half-hour ago and replaced Debug_Printf & File_Printf with
I_WriteDebug Procedure in I_System.C and:

With the time at 2:45pm got 495 errors and 850 warnings under MSVC.

Removed __attribute__ ((const)) references from W_Wad.H and:

With the time at 2:50pm got 180 errors and 587 warnings under MSVC.

Added MAXINT #define to the WIN32 part of I_Defs.H. MSVC views this as
INT_MAX. I getting confused and cynical.

Added numerous 'standard' include files to the WIN32 part of I_Defs.H. A
lot of these are not included in MSVC. So I'm going to be writing some
functions to compensate.

With the time at 3:10pm got 202 errors and 543 warnings under MSVC.

Wrote strcasecmp and strncasecmp functions. Added files I_COMPEN.C/H
to hold these functions. I'm not sure these functions do exactly what
their DJGPP counterparts do, so I going to download the source for GCC
to make sure. They do seem to fit the info file description.

With the time at 3:45pm got 203 errors and 536 warnings under MSVC.

Removed all the inline functions I could find. It would appear that I
missed about 33 of them :(.

I just do a full DJGPP compile and tested TNT MAP01. Seems to be
functioning fine. Now to see if MSVC will give me a break...

With the time at 3:55pm got 159 errors and 523 warnings under MSVC.

Replaced all the occurances of 'long long' with 'Int64', I missed quite
a few of these also :(.

Removed all the old system specific stuff that I hadn't replaced in
I_*.*. I will complete the code in WIN32 system spec stuff when the main
source tree compiles (not links) without error.

With the time at 4:20pm got 106 errors and 504 warnings under MSVC.

Took a break. Remarked out the internals of blur_view in R_Vbinit.C,
the MSVC compiler does not like inline functions written inline of a
function. I have no intention of adding #ifdef WIN32 or #ifndef DJGPP
defines into the main source. This means that the functions needs to
be re-written.

With the time at 4:45pm got 53 errors and 503 warnings under MSVC.

Removed MAXINT and replaced it with INT_MAX. There is one reference and
this #define is support by both MSVC and DJGPP.

Added the access defines in DJGPP's to WIN32 of I_DEFS.H. This covers
the file access defines used.

Remarked out the "portable" code in E_IdentifyVersion. Its another
POSIX standard code. Not MSVC specific and we must be as portable
as possible. Its a throw up between coding the functions for them or
re-writting this E_IdentifyVersion. I think I'll go with the latter.

With the time at 5:10pm got 36 errors and 494 warnings under MSVC.

The rest of the errors are allocation in the form:

void A_Procedure(int arraynum)
{
int array[arraynum]; // this is barely legal on any compiler
}

All this working around microsoft stuff is teaching me some bad habits. I
just re-wrote a procedure I planned and designed BEFORE hand. Its works
an all, which is good. E_IdentifyVersion has been written to lose all
the none portable stuff.

DATE: 1999/09/19

(Mostly done on the fly, my apologies for their short abrupt nature).

Added all system specifics through i_defs.h.

Had to make a change in Crosshair code: it was using chdir as a int,
which caused conflict with the func definition in unistd. I think we
should consider uses a graphic from the crosshair here.

Removed conflict in wi_stuff.c. A patch_t* time became time_patch,
conflicting with time.h func. Stupid name used here.

Removed every reference to CD Audio. CD Audio is to be considered a
music type just like any other.

Disabled CPU Checking. All Functions used are now C Only.

I_EnterGraphicsMode got moved to I_Video.c, has been greatly simplified
by removing the select_blit_function and all relating stuff. I think that
this was probably more trouble than its worth. During the optimisation
of EDGE, it may be worth testing the true value of this.

I_TruecolInfo (something I managed to omit from my system spec report)
got moved to I_Video.C.

Removed:
MUS_*.* files as these are system specific to allegro/DJGPP.
I_ALL*.* files also for the reason above.

All I_*.* are moved to SYSTEM directory.
I_DEFS.H Remains in the main directory.
All files include "i_defs.h", but no other i_* files.
Added I_GetHomeDirectory() to I_System.C.
Added EDGEHOMEDIR and EDGECONFIGFILE #defines to i_defs.h.
Disabled (Remarked out) always-run code in G_GAME.C.
Disabled (Remarked out) M_ScreenShot code. Used system specs.
Disabled (Remarked out) out all ASM code from the source tree.

All system specific includes that do not need to be viewed by main source
is now included in i_sysinc.h.

Removed I_Error/I_Music/I_Input.H and transferred entries to
i_system.h. Removed all CD Cheats and code from M_*.* files.

DATE: 1999/09/18
(Yes, this is no mistake. It has been a year)

Added a name to the error message to W_CheckNumForName, a useful error
message goes a long way.

I spent the last day or so finding with system specifics that are spread
throughout the code and re-gigging the order for a lot. Work changing all
the old DOSDoom Code into EDGE stuff is far from complete and somethings
are in desperate need of reworking. A good example is the number of
parameter checks in D_DoomMain() - soon to be come E_EDGEMain().

DATE: 1998/09/15

One of major problems with having to break an engine in-order to fix
it properly is that it can quite often turn into a long slog of a job,
one of the major things that needed to be fixed were the saved games,
which had to be altered on a large scale to handle the additional pointers
that otherwise would be left undeclared and a definite crash hazard.

One of the many things that has been added to the program structures
are linked-lists (attack types, current game objects (mobj_t) and so
forth). The purpose was to make it easy to do a linear search, although
the speed of a search is not the fastest possible.

One of the possible solutions for pointers is to declare them as NULL and
get the game to assign values again: however the problem that exist that
some pointers would be looked for would be found to be NULL and in some
cases will crash the game (due to the fact that the number of safeguards
in the code is designed to prevent crashes on a running game and assumes
that the procedures are correctly handling pointers) also monsters would
be asleep when the game is resumed, since they have no knowledge of
targets etc; the cheat ability is not good, so this option was scrapped.

The second option and the one I have choosen to implement is to record
the position in the linked-list of that type. Therefore the position
of the target is the current mobj_t list is recorded and restored on
loading the game. This works because the mobj_t list is stored in the
save game using the same order as was present in the game on saving;
the reconstruction order is the same as in the save game. The only
flaw in this is that it assumes that the information lists (mobjinfo_t,
attacktype_t etc..) are in the same order on loading as they were when
saved, this is always correct if the procedures and files for DDF are the
same. May be worth storing a checksum of the DDF Files within a savegame.

The new warp parameter is: -Warp Since currently only Doom II is
functional thats usually MAPxx, so for map 05, you would use -WARP MAP05.

DATE: 1998/09/13

Added Fixed and Time Functions to the DDF reader, it is now possible
to use both time & fixed-point numbers using numbers with a decimal
point: all commands that need such numbers have been altered. This was
something that needed to be added to the reader for some time: Since in
order to function remotely, DOSDoom requires information in the form of
these numbers.

Another minor change I made to the reader, was the that the file was
read directly into memory and then examined as opposed to the reading
and interpretation directly from the file.

Teleports no longer use a set effect object for the start and exit points
of a teleporting thing. They can be now be defined in sceneryDDF and are
indicated by the linedeftype. The linedeftype can specify the effect
object at the position left (in) and the position reached (out). SFX
cannot be specificed directly, based on the fact that the teleport
effect creates the noise. This new system allows for slient teleporters,
invisible effects that just produce noise and different teleport types:
the hardest trouble I had implementing this the hash table search :).

Finished the final work on making the commands in linedef more friendly
to the joe-dooming-public.

DATE: 1998/09/11

I probably not the best person to work with any type of graphics or
the like and I very much tend not touch them with a barge pole, however
I have been working with mobj->playxtra to test its effects when used
with a DOSDoom defined creature. Originally Doom used to create alterate
palettes (calculated at runtime) which were based on the base palette with
the exception of altering 0x70->0x7f (Player Sprite Greens) to another
group of colours: The original colours were GREY (called indigo), BROWN
& RED; they were a form of re-indexing basically, so when a sprite was
drawn and had the flags that setup GREY, BROWN or RED, they would use
an the alternate palette instead of the base when the sprite was drawn
- this translation (remapping) is done at DrawColumn level. Instead of
using flags, JC's new 8 player support had to use 4 more colours and as
opposed to using more flags, he choose to use a byte (playxtra) that held
the number of the translation table (an alternate palette). John Cole had
purposed that we use an indexing system (start palette colour, number of
colours used) for remapping patches, other multiplayer related stuff and
I suppose the player sprite-greens also. I originally implemented the
indexing code into patches code (the menu-colour alterations in V0.64
for example) - this system had only one real flaw: To work properly the
base palette had to be set out in 16 shades of one colour, 16 shades of
another and so forth; continuing through the 256 colours (16 colours
with 16 shades). Unfortunately the base palette was only organised in
places like this, not all of it: this made any remapping limited, the
problem was that to get any sharp contrasting colours, you would of had
to remap spreading yourself through the palette. This disallowed decent
contrasting white shade and a few other colours!

Note: The translation patching in V0.64 remapped all colours into the
16 indexed.

My solution is simple, have a pre-compiled remap lump that allows the
maximum of 32 colours be re-indexed to create new translation tables. A
table consists of 32 remaps, a remap consists of two bytes: the first held
the number of the colour index to be replaced, the second held the colour
index that would used in replacing. A single remap table would therefore
take up only 64 bytes (although expansion to include remapping of the
entire palette may be wise and would take up 512 bytes pre table). The
wad entry lump that I have included to use this is called PALREMAP and
consists of 21 remap tables:

1) Player Green -> Player Grey (Indigo?)
2) Player Green -> Player Brown
3) Player Green -> Player Dull Red
4) Player Green -> Orange
5) Player Green -> Light Grey
6) Player Green -> Bright Red
7) Player Green -> Pink
8) Player Green -> Gold
9) Player Green -> Blue
10) Player Green -> Dark Blue
11) Player Green -> Dark Green
12) Player Green -> Dark Red
13) Player Green -> Red Skin
14) Player Green -> Pale Skin
15) Player Green -> Grey
16) Text Colour Red -> White
17) Red Skin -> Pale Skin
18) Red Skin -> Grey Skin
19) Red Skin -> Blue Skin
20) Red Skin -> Green Skin
21) Red Skin -> Bright Red Skin

The player-green remaps are for multiplayer sprites, the Text Colour
Red remap is used for the white text and the Red-Skin remaps are test
remaps, the red-skin types are used for virtually ever doom creature
for skin or blood (most notable are the Demon (whole body), the Baron
(Torso) and the Chaingunner (Clothing); to demo this remapping use the
commandline parameter '-andymagic'): I'm sure a skilled artist could do
a more impressive job of this.

Missing:
Draw Translucent-Translated Column routine; This is something that is
was never written from when the translucency code was added (before the
team was created). The translucency is drawn, but none of the colour
translation (remapping) is handled - NEEDED URGENTLY - would recommend
C & ASM Versions; also I would recommend that someone ASM-codes the
translucency code: those plasma firing games slow to a crawl.....

Worked on an idea for expanding the key selection that I put to Kester,
with his recent developments on linedefs. It is now possible to list
the keys you need for a door and the suggest if you need either one of
the listed keys or require all of the listed keys (you can now give a
list of keys in the linesDDF file). It is now possible to say "you must
have the red skull, blue card & yellow skull" or "you need either a red
skull or a blue skull". I also had to alter the status bar (st_stuff.c)
to show a combination graphic for having both the keys & cards of a
specific colour. (added STKEYS6 -> 8 to DOSDoom.WAD) I recommend someone
looks into better gfx for these!

DATE: 1998/09/09

More minor bug fixing: 1) many WAD's like TeamTNT's Eternal WAD use an
effect which causes a floor, a set of stairs or a door to make an instant
movement, unfortunately this effect is a WAD Hack, as opposed to design
feature. Kester's code had correctly assumed the movement direction
required, but the movement speed being used was the default and was not
the instant effect required by the WADs. Therefore the different default
of -1 was used, which now represents instant movement and can be applied
to any linedef. The problem here was the WAD trick used, not the code:
it was correct.

2) I mixed up the teleport stomp code, if the thing stomping was a player
and the currentmap flags had MPF_NOSTOMP set, then no stomp would take
place; should of been if the thing stomping was not player...oops.

DATE: 1998/09/07

Bug-fixes: "Stuck-to-a-special-line" monster bug was detected and prompty
swatted, the problem was that P_TryMove was testing the movement over
special lines and returning false only when the object was referencing a
line that it was on the back of, it wasn't taking into account that the
linedef could not be activited by the object in question. The solution
was to that the activate procedure would return true or false to the
question, is it possible for the action to happen, this is then used as
the the return value for P_TryMove if the object-in-question was on the
front side of a special line.

"Changing sector ceiling/floor texture" bug, the problem was the
movingPlane structure, it had a set definition for the texture - char
tex[9] and due to use of void pointers, and error was not generated
when an attempt at mallocing space for a string and giving it to tex;
suffice to say that the string referencing was way off. fixed by changing
tex[9]->*tex.

Fixed two compiler warnings in lu_sound.c & i_sound.c.

Formatting: I have a wierd tab setting which makes a lot of source files
look odd. Its not unusual for me to go through the code and reformat
code from:

if (onenumber == anothernumber) {
anothernumber = 0;
onenumber = 10;
}

to:

if (onenumber == anothernumber)
{
anothernumber = 0;
onenumber = 10;
}

Its all spaces aswell, so no confusion arises...

DATE: 1998/09/06

Toyed with a few ideas, had a nice thought on a meandering state sequence
and player supporting monsters, by midday I had all the imps ripping
apart everything, but me on MAP18 of Doom II. Works very well. Will push
it further and iron out any bugs; might be a useful extension to DDF.

Received an update from Kester and merged my bugfixs from two days ago
and the current new ideas with the codebase. Worked fine, I made a point
of flicking through the linedef pages to make sure it all worked and
I understood it: also I did some cleaning up of the code in general I
viewed so I could understand it myself!

Had to make a few modifications to the new mouse/joystick handling
code. The Joystick code (in i_system.c) had a problem with joy_hat
as a static int or anything for that matter, so I had to modify the
code accordingly (everything names joy_hat became joy_ht); secondly,
the two-stage turning (the first 6 tics of turning are slow, the rest
are done at the speed of the actual movement) was only designed to work
with the Joystick and the keyboard, NOT the mouse. It makes playing with
the mouse (as I do) very awkward: therefore I have added a two_stage
turning option the analogue option menu. The menu has been renamed from
mouseoptions -> analogueoptions.

It seems that a lot of the code had been written to make any movements
by the analogue object (be it mouse or joystick) to be greatly reduced,
this meant that the mouse movement was so low that it became unplayable
therefore I have set up a slider for forward/slide/turning movement,
that allows the user to select the best choice. I did remember that this
was once one of the reasons I used to play Doom95 over Doom in DOS: the
mouse sensitivity was better arranged in Doom95, with this new method
it allows for proper config of the mouse for each user. A well-choosen
set of defaults would not go a miss here either.

"The Transporters are off-line" bug; not a bug really, just an oversight,
the teleport procedure in P_telept.C was looking for MT_TELEPORTMAN in
every sector for its destination - oops, again - the type references
are no longer relevant to any object created within the game, therefore
no destination points were being found. I fixed the problem by using
the mobj linked list to find an mobj (referencing the specials[])
in that sector, the other bug I found in the code was for some reason
the distance of the fog from the teleporting object was 40*FRACUNIT,
when it should be 20*FRACUNIT.

DATE: 1998/09/04

Fixed two irrating bugs I made with the P_ActShotAttack: first I was
not setting the correct source angle, which meant that targeting wasn't
happening. most notable on MAP29 of Doom II; where the chaingunner on
the opposite ledge should hit the guys in front of you at the beginning
of the level, however he spent most the time firing above our heads
(the enemy and the player object). I made the mistake of subtituting
(zero) for the object angle, oops. Error number 2: If the horzaccshift
was zero that the objangles angle would be altered by (Random Number -
Random Number) bit shifted left (<<) by horzaccshift - yes I should make
sure I'm awake before coding. oops again. In my process of missing the
object, I did solve the problem of bullets hitting the base of wall with
a backsector that had a sky-hack ceiling.

Sorted the demo recording and playback. The problem was that the
startskill was nor being stored at all, when you started. Not a good
thing, sorted that. Also the demos now record the DDF Name of the level,
so that its not limited by the gamemap/episode system...

Just a note: the top bugfix about when the bullets don't show up
against a wall is a good example why demo support of V1.9 is not a
good idea. Spawning smoke/puff from a wall uses P_Random(), immediately
de-syncing any demo on the spot because the Random Number Generator is
now out of sync.

DATE: 1998/08/05 -> 1998/08/29

Remember to update often or you leave yourself a hell of Log to write and
a lot to remember. During the last fortnight I have began to implement
some more major parts of DDF: Creatures/levels/game-setup/languages. For
Languages, lu_str.h & lu_str.c have been replaced by ddf_lang.c. This
file uses an external file - an LDF (not a DDF) file - which holds the
definitions for a language, when DOSDoom looks for a language definition
it uses DDF_LanguageLookup(char *ref). The reference it gives is checked
against the Language linked list and if the ref is found it will return
a pointer to the string referenced itself.

In order to do this I had to add a string reading function to the
DDF_Reader, as like all parsers it relys on characters to direct it,
the string function uses the normal '"' action, that when one is found
it reads every character for what it is: ignoring nothing, the only
exception is that the DDF Parser will detect the '\n' sequence and
substitute a carriage return: when another '"' is found the parser
returns to normal operation.

An LDF is formatted like this:
<DefinitionName>=<String>

so:
MAP01Desc="MAP01: ENTRYWAY";

defines "MAP01Desc" as a reference for "MAP01: ENTRYWAY", which means that
DDF_LanguageLookup("MAP01Desc") returns a pointer to "MAP01: ENTRYWAY"
obviously. This is used when a DDF needs a string, for example: Items.ddf
needs a message to display when an item is picked up, this entry is
added to an item in items.ddf:

PICKUP_MESSAGE=GotMediKit;

would ref this in an LDF:
GotMediKit="Picked up a medikit, hey!";

so that when this object was picked up it would ref "GotMediKit" in an
LDF and for the example LDF "Picked up a medikit, hey!" would be printed.

I have implemented a linked list to replace to current set array for
the mobjinfo table, with the removal of the type enum (soon to be
effected). The number of mobjinfo types in now "limitless". There is
a small table of (mobjinfo_t *specials[NUMMOBJSPEC]) pointers to the
specials in the list that will be needed regardless of what other things
are added.

The specials are: Player, Smoke, Blood, Puff, Teleport Fog, Respawn Fog
and the teleport-end position.

This work has taken place now as it is a requirement that needs to be
achieved for DDF, the handling of set down - thing related must be dealt
with a reference to its info ref. 90% of this work was done on the 6th
so if need to view the changes: look for -ACB- 1998/08/06 in the files
P_Enemy.C, P_Map.C & Rad_Trig.C.

Implemented and setup the map structure; A map has the following
attributes:

typedef struct mapstuff_s
{
char *name; // DDF Name
char *description; // Description (automap etc..)
char graphicname[9]; // Name used in Intermission
char lump[9]; // lump name in the WAD
char sky[9]; // graphic sky name
char music[9]; // music name
char surround[9]; // flat used for the surround
int flags; // flags (see below)
int partime; // par-time
struct intermis_s *interscr; // intermission screen type
struct mapstuff_s *next; // next in the maplist
struct mapstuff_s *nextlevel; // next level to go
char *nextmapname; // name of the next normal level
char *secretmapname; // name of the secret level
}
mapstuff_t;

The pointer nextlevel is set when an exit is reached at the end of the
currentmap: if the secret exit is used, the name is secretmapname is
searched for (compared against each DDF name) and when a match is found,
a pointer to it is passed to nextlevel, the nextmapname is used in the
same fashion when the level is exited normally.

Map Handling FLAGS:
Each map has a set of flags, with the id levels only MPF_NOSTOMP is set
(with the exception of Map30 of DoomII/TNT/Plutonia, because monsters
can stomp you). For new levels, designers have the option to disable such
features that effect gameplay or force others. A purist can disable all
the new features: these flags override the gameplay menu; if a designer
forces a setting, the option menu will not change it.

typedef enum
{
MPF_NOJUMPING = 1, // Disable Jumping
MPF_NOMLOOK = 2, // Disable Freelook
MPF_NOTRANSLUC = 4, // Disable Translucency
MPF_NOCHEATS = 8, // Disable Cheats
MPF_ITEMRESPAWN = 16, // Force Item Respawn
MPF_NOITEMRESPN = 32, // Disable Item Respawn
MPF_FAST = 64, // Force Fast Monsters
MPF_RESMONSTER = 128, // Force Resurrect Monsters
MPF_TELMONSTER = 256, // Force Teleport Monsters
MPF_STRETCHSKY = 512, // Force Stretch Sky
MPF_NORMALSKY = 1024, // Force Normal Sky
MPF_NOTRUE3D = 2048, // Disable True 3D Gameplay
MPF_NOSTOMP = 4096, // Monsters cannot stomp players
MPF_NORMBLOOD = 8192 // Use Normal Blood activity
}
mapsettings_t;

ATTACKS...
I have finished through the creature.ddf/attacks.ddf files, which handle
the movement/actions of the other moving objects in DOSDoom. Formally in
a attack frame, the procedure called was specific: an A_* procedure. All
new DDF code is P_Act*.* and is used within P_Action.C. The difference
between the original code and DDF handling is that you setup a ranged
attack and/or close combat attack and called a procedure during a
state that calls the individual attack or make a choice between each
one. Normally, the object would use a very specific routine, i.e for a
baron-of-hell it would fire the item enumed MT_BRUISERSHOT which did a
damage in the range of 1-to-8 and multiplied by a number (depending on
the missile itself), 8 for our example. The only thing that defined what
the objects attack was the very specific attack routines used by the
object states, Unfortunately this wasn't very useful for defining and
handling of attacks. Instead we have a new attack structure that defines
an attack and represents the choosen form of aggression by an object:

typedef struct attacktype_s
{
char *name; // Attack name (referencing)
int attackstyle; // Attackstyle
int initsound; // Initialisation Sound
int sound; // Misc Sound
int accuracy; // Accuracy of the attack
int xoffset; // X-offset relative to the obj (proj only)
int yoffset; // Y-offset relative to the obj (proj only)
int height; // Height from the floor (proj only)
int range; // Maximum range of the assault
int speed; // Speed (Launch-self assault only)
int flags; // Flags
int count; // Count (Shot attacks, multiple blasts)
int tooclose; // If less than, close to target for attack
int damage; // Set Damage Value
int damagerange; // Damage Range (Doom Damage Calc)
int damagemulti; // Damage Multiplier (Doom Damage Calc)
int objinitstate; // Spawned object initial state
int notracechance; // Chance of no tracing (Tracers only)
struct mobjinfo_s *projectile; // Object to create
struct attacktype_s *next; // Next in the list of attacks.
}
attacktype_t;

Attack->Name:
Used for descriptive and reference purposes, stores the name given to
it by the user (in attacks.ddf) and is referenced by the creatures in
creatures.ddf.

Attack->Attackstyle:
An attackstyle can be any of the following:

typedef enum
{
	ATK_PROJECTILE, // Projectile: some sort of flying object
	ATK_SPAWNER, // Spawner: Spawns a defined object in targets direction
	ATK_TRIPLESPAWNER, // Spawner: Spawns a defined object in three directions
	ATK_SPREADER, // Spreader: shoots projectiles in a spread (fixed)
	ATK_RANDOMSPREAD, // Spreader: shoots projectiles in a spread (random)
	ATK_SHOT, // Shot: Pellet Warfare, traces line to target
	ATK_TRACKER, // Tracker: Launch an attack that follows
	ATK_CLOSECOMBAT, // Close-combat: do damage direct
	ATK_SKULLFLY, // Launch Self: Attack using self as the missile

attackstyle_t;

ATK_PROJECTILE:
Launchs an attack at the object's target; Uses the attack->height,
attack->xoffset & attack->yoffset to define where the projectile starts
from. The positions are relative to the object firing, the height is got
from object->z + attack->height. A minus xoffset gives a position to the
left of the object, a positive one gives a position to the right of the
object. A minus yoffset gives a position behind the object, a positive
one in front of an object. Normally both xoffset and yoffset are 0. Note:
if there is a blocking line between the object and the projectile pos,
it will not be fired.

ATK_SPAWNER:
Launches a spawned object towards its target and the new object's
initial state is held in attack->objinitstate. This can be used to a
good advantage: the pain elemental uses the second attack frame of a
lost soul to make sure it hurtles towards the target when it is spawned.

ATK_TRIPLESPAWNER:
Same as above, but spawns an object behind, to the left and to the
right of the attacker; this was purely designed for the spawning of the
lost souls upon death of a pain elemental. However It can be put to an
inventive use me thinks.

ATK_SPREADER:
A Spreader is an project that is aimed at its target and then the angle
is then offset. The purpose of this is to counter balance the movement
of the object's target. The Doom user of this is the Mancubus. The goes
through a fixed cycle:

1) Object angle is altered by 11.25 degrees.
2) Projectile angle is altered by 11.25 degrees.
3) Object angle is altered by -11.25 degrees.
4) Projectile angle is altered by 22.5 degrees.
5) Projectile angle is altered by -5.625 degrees.
6) Projectile angle is altered by 5.625 degrees.

The action RESET_SPREADER (P_ActResetSpreadCount) resets the order to
1 should it be required.

ATK_RANDOMSPREADER:
Same as the above, except that the projectile only is altered by an
angle offset that is the numeric value for 90 degrees divided by a
"random-number" between 1 and 64. More unpredictable this is.

ATK_SHOT:
Bullet warfare; This is the attack that covers shotting with pistols,
shotguns & chainguns etc. How it works is by tracing a path from the
source and following it until it hits a wall or another object. If it is
a thing the relevant damage is done and the relevant effect takes place
(blood or smoke depending on the thing), if it hits a wall, floor or
ceiling, then smoke is generated. The ACCURACY setting is something that
comes into play here: multiple firing objects cannot be accurate or they
would do some serious damage, so making the shots less then accurate
simulates reality as any machine gun will not have the accuracy of a
sniper rifle.

ATK_TRACKER:
Spawns the attack->projectile at the position of the target, what happens
next is dependent on both the projectile and the attacker. This attack
was designed upon the Arch-Vile attack. To emulate the arch-vile attack,
the tracker (attack->projectile) would use the TRACKER_FOLLOW actions
where it would follow its assigned target if it the attacker can see its
target, thats all the tracker will do. The action now happens where the
attacker uses EFFECT_TRACKER: This basically causes the explosion damage;
If the tracker for one reason or another does not exist, the explosion
damage is not done, but the basic damage is done. The explosion damage
is obviously done if the tracker still exists. Although this is the
primary purpose of the tracker, it can be used to spawn an explosion at
the target area. In true you can spawn any projectile at its target.

ATK_CLOSECOMBAT:
Does calculated damage to the attackers target if the attacker is within
meleerange of it's target. Nice and simple.

ATK_SKULLFLY:
Launchs its self at speed towards its target and does damage on
collision. This is called SKULLFLY because it is the attack used by
the lost-soul.

Attack->initsound:
This is the SFX number used when an attack is being attempted, it is
called automatically using (P_ActSkullAttack - ATK_SKULLFLY) or can
be called using actions CLOSEATTEMPTSND (P_ActMakeCloseAttemptSound) &
RANGEATTEMPTSND (P_ActMakeRangeAttemptSound).

Attack->sound:
SFX Number referenced when an attack takes place. This is different for
each attack:

ATK_CLOSECOMBAT - Sound made when closecombat damage is done.
ATK_SHOT - Sound made when attack is made.
ATK_SKULLFLY - Sound made when attacker hits target.
ATK_TRACKER - Sound made when tracker is put into effect.

ATK_SPREADER       }
ATK_RANDOMSPREADER }- Sound made when projectile is launched.
ATK_PROJECTILE     }

ATK_SPAWNER / ATK_TRIPLESPAWNER - Sound made when object is spawned.

Attack->accuracy
Accuracy level, if zero the shot is perfect, otherwise it performs an
random offset bitshifted varied by the accuracy level. This effects the
angle of the attack.

To be completed.....

DATE: 1998/08/04

Added source (struct mobj_s*) to the mobj_t: it is clear trying to make
any sense of the procedures was difficult with confusing references. For
example: the spawn missile procedure places the source of the procedure
in mobj->target, its makes things worse when tracers (revenant missiles)
& fires have to know their targets. The original id solution was to add
a new struct mobj_s* tracer to hold it - suffice to say it was bloody
confusing when reading the code through, the new suitation is:

* mobj->source - holds the source of the missile/fire
* mobj->target - holds the target of any object
* mobj->tracer - holds the fire for the source mobj (normally an
arch-vile)

P_Mobj.C, P_Map.C & P_Enemy.C require changes.

It worth noting for all those people who use DOSDoom as a base and stops
them getting as confused as me :).

Implemented a fix from Erik Sandberg to allocate space for stateinfo in
DDF_MainSplitIntoState: some moron who remain nameless (i.e. me) forgot to
allocate space for it, something that Win95 appeared to let me get away
with. In DOS it would crash out with a page fault (for obvious reasons).

Fixed the problem within the resurrect code that cause monsters to start
up and head off in one direction and do nothing until it hit a wall:
The movecount was not being reset to Zero, movecount is being used as
a counter until respawn. (In P_Mobj.C).

Added P_MobjCreateObject, this procedure is the same as P_SpawnMobj
with the exception of using a pointer to an mobjinfo_t as opposed to
a enum reference. Eventually P_SpawnMobj will be removed. As a lot of
new procedures, or modified versions of existing ones come into play,
the original ones will be deleted as they are not needed. This is for
the transition to DDF from the fixed style originally used. I'm looking
at naming procedures with a ref to the file they are in aswell as the
type of procedure they are..for example:

P_RemoveFlyingMissile -> P_MobjRemoveMissile P_itemRespawn ->
P_MobjItemRespawn has been done: P_Mobj is the file, the latter is a
description. Its good for people who need to pick up the source and
educational purposes.

Added/Finalised the attacktype_t which will be used when a mobj goes on
the offensive, the mobj_t has a currentattack and mobjinfo_t holds two:
closecombat and rangeattack.

Added new procedures to P_action.C for the attacks side of DDF:
P_ActLaunchMissile is like P_SpawnMissile, however the type of missile
launched is an mobjinfo_t* not an enum plus uses the new attacktype_t
to discern what projectile is fired, offsets used, height of attack
etc.. P_ActCheckMissileSpawn is the same as P_CheckMissileSpawn in
P_enemy.C: the code is placed here as eventually P_CheckMissileSpawn
will be removed for P_enemy.C as it will no longer be needed.

Moved the #define BASEYCENTER to a global variable that is calculated in
multires setup. BASEYCENTER is used player weapons. There was a minor
offset that "fixed" weapon heights for 400x300 and 800x600 because of
the different aspect ratio, the offset being an increase. This caused
weapons in a res of 640x400 to appear one pixel above the bottom of the
screen, this is fixed by reducing the offset, if this is not done by
half a FRACUNIT the weapon clipping is wrong for 400x300 and 800x600.

DATE: 1998/07/31

Rewrote the entire Items.DDF & Scenery.DDF files to pick the sprite
at each state this was necessary, because I had not anticipated the
combinations of sprites that have occured, one name for the spawned
object and a different name for the death frames.

All the DDF_*.* have been changed to reflect the use of a void pointer in
commandlist_t: it was previously a int pointer, I had made the mistake
of not setting this as void earlier, so that it is generic. allows the
use of any data type pointer in commandlist_t third parameter.

A dummy procedure exists to replace procedures that have no useful
function on certain DDF files (switches and animations for example,
they do not need to read the name).

P_RemoveFlyingMissile was added to p_mobj.c, this was to handle missiles
that went through the sky properly. The missile should remove itself,
but it should not stop the sound it is playing, the fact it is the
sky doesn't mean you cannot hear the sound. New code has been added to
handle a missile hitting a floor or ceiling that is a sky-hack (P_Z &
P_XYMovement).

Added in Kester's additional code: DDF_Anim.C has been added.

DATE: 1998/07/30

Bug fixes mostly: Ghosting BUG caused when an arch-vile or new nightmare
respawn raises a creature that was gibbed (Height and Radius of Zero)
and the radius and height remain like this, height and radius are now
restored from the info table, not the fallen mobj.

Fixed the spawning of a stasis imp at 0,0 - P_KillMobj was not setting
the mobj with a MF_DROPPED flag and when the item was attempting to
respawn an object that held no info on its original status or position.

Itemrespawn-que was made "limitless" and different respawn times are now
possible, this has been added to Items DDF. As opposed to two set lists of
time and mapthings, it is now a double-linked list of items. item-in-que
being the entry.

newnmrespawn, respawnparm & respawnmonsters have been replaced with
respawnsetting; Nice and easy with one.

Added these files to cover DDF Requirements:
DDF_ATK.C - Attack types
DDF_CTRE.C - Creature types
DDF_GAME.C - Game Configuration
DDF_LEVL.C - Level Configuration
DDF_LINE.C - Linedefs
DDF_SECT.C - Sector Definitions
DDF_SWTH.C - Switch Definitions
DDF_WEAP.C - Player Weapons

DATE: 1998/07/29

Removed some of those awful goto's that existed in P_Map.C; trying
to trace a goto is a bastard most of time, without it being badly
done. I also removed A_ChaseNoMissile from P_Enemy.C, this was an
earlier replacement for several goto's within A_Chase and found a more
understandable way of writing the code. Found a bug in D_IdentifyVersion,
it was adding Plutonia in DOSDoom mode (it should only add Doom.wad &
Doom2.wad); I reworked an old version of the code I had written and
replaced the existing that works, looks in the correct directory and
loads the right wads (sorry, Kester - had to nuke your code again).

Heres a description of the DDF Parser, which is long overdue.

The DDF Parser is a simple reader that is very limited in error checking,
however it can adapt to most tasks, as is required for the variety of
stuff need to be loaded in order to configure the DOSDoom Engine.

The parser will read an ascii file, character by character an interpret
each depending in which mode it is in; Unless an error is encountered
or a called procedure stops the parser, it will read everything until
EOF is encountered.

When the parser function is called, a pointer to a readinfo_t is passed
and contains all the info needed, it contains:

message - message displayed on the screen.
filename - filename to be read, returns error if NULL
DDF_MainCheckName - function called when a def has been just began
DDF_MainCreateEntry - function called when a def has been completed
DDF_MainFinishingCode - function called when EOF is read
currentcmdlist - Current list of commands
Also when commands are referenced, they use currentcmdlist, which is a
pointer to a list of entries, the entries are formatted like this:

name - name of command
routine - function called to interpret info
numeric - pointer to an int value (possibly changed by routine)
name is compared with the read command, to see if it matchs. routine
called to interpret info, if command name matches read command. numeric
is used if a numeric value needs to be changed, by routine.

The different parser modes are:
waiting_newdef
reading_newdef
reading_command
reading_data
reading_remark

'waiting_newdef' is only set at the start of the code, At this point
every character with the exception of DEFSTART is ignored. When DEFSTART
is encounted, the parser will switch to reading_newdef. DEFSTART the
parser will only switches modes and sets firstgo to false.

'reading_newdef' reads all alphanumeric characters and the '_' character -
which substitudes for a space character (whitespace is ignored) - until
DEFSTOP is read. DEFSTOP passes the read string to DDF_MainCheckName
and then clears the string. Mode reading_command is now set. All read
stuff is passed to char *buffer.

'reading_command' picks out all the alphabetic characters and passes them
to buffer as soon as COMMANDREAD is encountered; DDF_MainReadCommand
looks through for a matching command, if none is found a fatal error
is returned. If a matching command is found, this function returns a
function pointer (into DDF_ReadFunction which is used to interpret the
data), a command reference number to command ref and sets the mode to
reading_data. if DEFSTART is encountered the procedure will clear the
buffer, run DDF_MainCreateEntry (called this as it reflects that in
Items & Scenery if starts a new mobj type, in truth it can do anything
procedure wise) and then switch mode to reading_newdef.

'reading_data' passes alphanumeric characters, plus a few other characters
that are also needed. It continues to feed buffer until a SEPERATOR or
a TERMINATOR is found. The difference between SEPERATOR and TERMINATOR
is that a TERMINATOR uses the DDF_ReadFunction and then sets the mode to
reading_command, whereas SEPERATOR uses the DDF_ReadFunction and a looks
for more data on the same command. This is how the multiply states and
specials are defined.

'reading_remark' does not process any chars except REMARKSTOP, everything
else is ignored. This mode is only set when REMARKSTART is found, when
this happens the current mode is held in formerstatus, which is restored
when REMARKSTOP is found.

The maximum size of BUFFER is set in the BUFFERSIZE define.

DDF_MainReadFile & DDF_MainProcessChar handle the main processing of the
file, all the procedures in the other DDF files (which the exceptions of
the Inits) are called directly or indirectly. DDF_MainReadFile handles
to opening, closing and calling of procedures, DDF_MainProcessChar makes
sense from the character read from the file.

DATE: 1998/07/27

Cleaned up P_Local.H to be understandable (just) and rewrote the
P_CalcHeight in P_User.C so that when dead, you don't bob. Also only
calculates bobbing when your are alive. Freelook is now limited by two
defines: LOOKUPLIMIT & LOOKDOWNLIMIT; Makes this readable.

New Action Procedures are now contained in new file P_Action.c; So all the
new action code was transfered from P_Enemy.c and use a prefix of P_Act*
as opposed to A_*. I hope to include all the new generic action code with
P_Action.C. DDF_Main.C's Action Pointer Table was changed to reflect this.

DATE: 1998/07/26

Stream-lined the existing DDF Code; I was still using some
virtually identical functions for some things, so DDF_MainGetNumeric,
DDF_MainLookupSound & DDF_MainCheckCommand replaced their ddf_item &
ddf_scen counterparts; passed a pointer to the respective commandlists
also, that being was the only difference in code. DDF_MainLoadStates also
had a minor revamp. Added the additional bits and pieces to sceneryDDF
for explosive items, now complete. Can be variable or set damage from
explosions.

DATE: 1998/07/25

Worked on the networking code, developed the extended options and made
the display more friendly. Continued expanding sceneryDDF to include
the explosive items (which at the moment stands at a barrel). I had a
lot a played with the idea of key selection. Looks like this will need
some changes to networking code. I have tested the networking code and
believe the problem caused by a true3d option. Will need to further
investigate that little problem.

DATE: 1998/07/24

Recieved ASM code from Rasem for the R_DrawColumn & R_DrawSpan; Very
impressed as it shaved a huge 4.7fps off the current speed in hicolour
mode. Although bits and pieces can be slower. DrawSpan is faster,
allowing for a noticable difference.

DATE: 1998/07/21

Removed the fatal error in P_SpawnMapThing (where it reads a thing that is
not defined, i.e. no matching doomednum in mobjinfo_t) for JDS Compliance,
this only makes a report to the debugfile when DEVELOPERS is defined.

Fixed the bug in P_FindNextHighestFloor: The procedure was not taking
into account floors of the same height, it should have been returning
this value.

DATE: 1998/07/20

Rethought a lot of the plans for DDF in DOSDoom, it was clearly apparent
that certain things need to be generalised (DDF) procedures; The "pellet
warfare" attacks should all be one procedure for example. Removed Menu
Shade Selections: maybe that wasn't such a great idea :). There are now
two control menus (standard & extended) based on the space and also the
two distinctive sets of controls. Standard Controls are need to play
the game; Extended Controls are assistance controls.

DATE: 1998/07/19

Fixed the flicking weapons bug (my fault, not resetting centerfrac in
r_things) and completed the integration of M Howe's Work. I have also
added in the NightVision code and added it to Items.ddf.

Continued by clean-up of the DDF Parser and added DDF_MainFinishingCode
which is called when the EOF is found on the current DDF File.

Added the following files:
DDF_Scen.C - Scenery Objects Parser Code
D_Debug.H - Kester's Debug File

Removed the 'offensive' end messages from dstrings.h (Note: fix the
filename) I was getting an increasing number of mails on this, so i
removed it and cleaned up the code in M_Menu.c.

Cleaned up DDF_Main.C & H again:
Removed any scenery items
Removed any unused states
Corrected the enums
Added the actions table (straight string comparison)
Added the specials table (straight string comparison)
Made states & sprite checking code generic, moved for ddf_items.c
Added addition action code to p_enemy.c (add new file to place this)
God knows what else.... :).
Added Kester's major bugfix to V_Init8 and V_Init16.

Added the i_love_bill setting in: use '-ihatebill' to switch it off.

DATE: 1998/07/17

The demos work fine, but the networking is completely up the creek
which is something I did anticipate and will need to spend some time
fixing. I have spent a lot of time playing around with the menus and
decided that the menu shades had to go and seperated the controls menu
into standard and extended controls. There is still a lot of work to
be done on the menu system. I took a look at the true3d stuff (putting
Martin Howe's stuff in) and realised that there are a few things that
were not anticipated by Kilbert the person who originally sent in the
code and I will need to talk to Martin on this.

The Debug File stuff in d_net.c, now has DEVELOPERS wrappers around and
uses the debug_Printf system from d_debug.h.

I attempted to add the code by Erik Sandberg for new Code for MMX, but it
sadly was not designed for a normal Pentium with MMX (K6 more like) and
even with the MMX code disabled it caused havoc with my sister's P120. So
I have remarked it out, until Erik can find the problem, also there are
problems with using it with an AWE64. However he did manage to get the
original ASM working with the limitless screen allocation bits (great!).

I will include More of Erik's, Dave's and Martin's work when I continue
the work on networking, cause it affects a lot of the work.

DATE: 1998/07/13

With Kester removal of the demolimit and made the required changes to the
ticcmd_t, vertangle and extbuttons added: vertangle is the change in the
vertical angle of a player weapon, extbuttons used for new dosdoom only
stuff; JUMPING etc. I had to add an entry to mobj_t also, vertangle again
- it is actually easier putting it here than in the player structure;
DOSDoom had a very hacked approach: it set a global variable that was
altered directly, It seems to work a lot better than it did before and
mlook is now record in demos and passed over the network, which breaks
compatibility with the original EXE. This compatiability is a pain, I feel
that when ID released a new version they cared little for compatibility
with older version so why should we?

DDF code got reworked, The code was rigged to only work for items DDF and
did not allow any flexability. The call to DDF_MainReadFile now passes a
pointer to a struct with the filename, message and the functions required.

I will be continuing my efforts to clean up the DDF parser code.

Took a dive into the Radius Trigger Parser, had to make some adjustments
so that DDF and Rad_triggers work together, the object generated is
referenced by its mapnumber (so the docs will need updating) and also
corrected an error where an object was being generated and its was not
checking whether it landed on something, therefore the object does not
generate if it lands on something.

DATE: 1998/07/04

Spent the entire week learning how NOT to fix certain problems; I
have been looking at getting the demos to sync properly: mlook is not
recorded in the demo as its implementation would require an few changes
to ticcmd_t; I do not know whether we should support original demos:
this causes problems as DOSDoom's handling of events is sufficently
different that of the id EXE. This requires further thought, One of the
major problems that always crops up is maintaining compatibility and I
am having my doubts about the wisdom of doing so.

Fixed a minor bug with weapon selection; Games without the double-barrel
now do not have a key to select them.

DATE: 1998/07/02

Demos now record as with a Version number of 065, the additional features
that would effect gameplay are now stored within the demo. Will be adding
the additional mlook code to it. Mlook will auto-aim if it can find a
target: if not the weapons shoots it the direction it was fired.

DATE: 1998/06/30

Apart from three bugs..is what I should have said: I was trying to
compare an unknown pointer with a string (amatuerish mistake). I have
been looking at at syncing the demos: Doom V1.9 sync without problem,
assuming you haven't got any of the features enabled, DOSDoom does not
record its addition features and this does cause some hiccups along the
way. I need to investigate further and solve any more problems that crop
up. Also added a CPU check at the beginning to assist the asm coders: it
will allow us to choose the specific routine optimial for that processor.

DATE: 1998/06/29

Hooked in the DDF Reader and apart from 2 bugs, if worked fine! The
items that are picked up are now defined in the items DDF. I need to do
more ground work to complete this for all functions, however I am a bit
happy. The work here was rewriting/writing the reader functions and the
correct handling for all of it. I'm too tired to explain the whole bunch
of things.

DATE: 1998/06/27

Finally got round to updating this log after numerous hic-cups. The
Ground work for weapon selection and DDF Items has been done, all that
needs to be done is the reader and the file itself.

I have had chance to add in code from:

Kester: Contined work of removing of limits, ddbug12.wad (Ian Wilson)
& runbuddy.wad (Chris Dale sent this) both now work! Hey, hey.

Martin: Ground work for a jetpack, added this as a benefit type for
DDF Items.

File changes:
LU_INFO.* => DDF_MAIN.*
DOOMSTAT.* => DM_STATE.*
DOOMDEF.* => DM_DEFS.*
DOOMDATA.* => DM_DATA.*
DOOMTYPE.* => DM_TYPE.*
LIBAMP.H => MUS_LIB1.H
JGMOD.H => MUS_LIB2.H
D_ITEMS.* => OBLIVION (got removed, table moved to DDF_MAIN.*)
OBLIVION => DDF_ITEM.* (New DDF Features)

SOURCE DIRECTORY CHANGES:
Removed DJGPP dir, moved contents back into Main directory. (Since we have
no time to work on LINUX Version, lets make things as simple as possible).
Added MAKEFILE for all those who don't like RHIDE. Added LIBS directory
and placed the LIBJGMOD.a & LIBAMP.a files. (The purpose of this is
that we should limit the size of src zip where possible, post sources
at the website).
P_INTER.C has been changed on a major scale, P_TouchSpecialThing has
been altered to give the benefit from the mobjinfo_t table as opposed
to checking to see what sprite the thing has (it was sprite-ist!).

All the procedures have been altered to accept actual amounts from the
things and also the limits imposed. The duration of each benefit can be
specfied assuming that the benefit is judged in length of time: as opposed
to the old method of a LUT, there is also a limit to the benefit time,
which is specified in the thing, to use the original effect you have give
the same amount as the limit (no higher, no lower - that value or else),
making bigger limits gives the user chance to top-up on the time they
have left on a benefit.

The Ammo amount is give directly, as opposed to number of clips for
that ammo.

If the armour value given is bigger than 100 the armour type is 2 (blue
armour class), else it is 1 (green armour class) - limit for this is
specified in the thing.

mobjinfo_t has a new addition - backpack_t (a pointer to), which contains
info on weapons held, ammo for all types, the most ammo carried for all
types, the keys carried, armour and the armour type. This allows multiple
different backpacks to be generated by DDF-Items.

P_SpawnPlayerBackpack (new Procedure in P_INTER.C) is a bit experimental,
it gives all the stuff a dead player died with and generates a backpack
with all this stuff in. It does work, but until the Multi-player works
properly I can't tell you if it works in deathmatch.

P_USER.C/ST_STUFF.C/P_INTER.C: Keys 1->7 have a mapping system, you
can choose a primary and secondary weapon for each key, if you have a
weaponed mapped to a specfic key it will show up on the weapons owned
table. It has no menu so far (working on it). It does mean that if the
Double-Barrel is owned, but the single-barrel is not then the number 3
will show up (which it did not before).

Changed the weapon enum order in to a logical order and gave the
weaponinfo_t a new entry - weapon name. This will be used in the
M_Option.C file for selecting weapons as described before-hand.

weaponupdate is the flags that tells the weapon widgets on the status
bar to update.

DDF_MAIN.C (DDF_OldThingInit) just sents up the benefits info for the
existing things, When I get the reader sorted, I will removed these and
their entries within mobjinfo[] and state[] tables.

DATE: 1998/06/18

Lesson: Don't bugger about with something you don't fully understand. The
modifications to I_ALLEGV.C cause more problems than it solved. I've
tracked the problem down to the use of allegblit(). When this is used
it treats black as being see-through, subed the use bankedblit instead.

added SCREENDEPTH a global variable that holds the calculation of
SCREENHEIGHT*BPP.

DATE: 1998/06/14

Reworked the PatchIndirect system, it normally scales the graphics
up to the actual res, which when your running 400x300 or 512x384 it
looks somewhat tackly, instead downsized the graphics to a ratio of
320x200. Anything that is between 320x200 and 640x400 has a scaled res
of 320x200, anything between 640x400 and 800x600 has a scaled res of
640x400 and so forth.

Attempt to fix the dodgy resolutions by forcing either the use of VGA
or VESA2L modes (which seemed to work for me) in I_ALLEGV.C.

The Options Menu and other text menus center themselves vertically.

New Mouse Options menu.

DATE: 1998/06/10

Add HUlib_drawTextLineTrans(), just like HUlib_drawTextLine() except it
uses the translation table for colour by JC. First Change: In Rad_trig.C
changed HUlib_drawTextLine() to HUlib_drawTextLineTrans() with grey as
the colour (TIP_DisplayTips).

Forced the status bar to refresh when a key is picked up. Fixes problem
when a key picked-up did not show up on the status bar. (P_GiveCard)
in P_Inter.C.

Added Linedefs #9000-9006 (scrolling walls), coded passed to me by
JC. P_SPEC.C (P_SpawnSpecials & P_UpdateSpecials). Piece of advice, don't
enable all of these at one room - does your head in! May have to change
to linedef number as not to impose on those already used by other ports.

DATE: 1998/06/09

Fixed the error with selecting the supershotgun in doom/utlimate
doom. added check for the gamemode in ST_STUFF.C. If the user tries
'idgive3' nothing will happen, 'idfa' and 'idkfa' do not make the
supershotgun available.

Users can no longer try 'idgive6' & 'idgive7' when in shareware doom
(also in ST_STUFF.C).

Removed all references to '-cdrom' parameter on account that noone should
be playing this from a CDROM.

Fixed the 'You haven't picked a quicksave slot yet!cD' Bug (also the
French Nightmare Message Bug). Insufficent space allocated from the
display string in m_menu.c (m_drawer), increase size from 40 to 50 chars.

Set the length of tips in rad_trig.c to 50 (56 is too big).

Fixed to problem with displaying HU_text at High Resolutions - Wasn't
not displaying the text (only half). (HU_LIB.C).

DATE: 1998/04/26

Notes:
Human Madness REMOVED
Human Explosions REMOVED
New AI Temporarily Removed
mobjinfo_t in INFO.H has new items - (Definable things) continuning

* P_ENEMY.C & INFO.C (new procedures):-
A_ChaseNoMissile - program re-structuring
A_ZombiePistolAttack - replaces A_POSATTACK (Definable things)
A_ZombieShotgunAttack - replaces A_SPOSATTACK (Definable things)
A_ZombieChaingunAttack - replaces A_CPOSATTACK (Definable things)
A_DeadlyPistolAttack - new accurate enemy pistol attack
A_DeadlyShotgunAttack - new accurate enemy shotgun attack
A_DeadlyChaingunAttack - new accurate enemy chaingun attack
A_StandardAttack - replaces normal enemy attack (not complete)
A_StandardRefire - replaces refire for CPOS, BSPI & SPID

Overview of changes:
Human Madness & explosions removed (crap I did earlier).

New AI was temp. removed - to be added to the definable thing.

The new procedures are added and existing ones are replaced to make
the doom engine more dynamic. The aim is to have all the thing info
loaded at runtime from a ASCII file - this will make dehacked obsolete
as you can directly tell the engine all the info for a thing and
modify it accordingly. This is the earliest very stable version I have
and the definable thing is well on its way to completion. Hopefully
doom with a -game parameter is possible. INFO.H is also the focus for
change. NB: Until I complete the standard attack procedure, all close
combat damage will be that of a Baron of Hell! A standard attack is
the normal attack used by imps, cacodemons, barons, hellknights,
cyberdemons and arachnotrons, it takes the missile type from the
actor->info, I have to work on a closecombat attacks - where
applicable.

A_ChaseNoMissile replaced a goto statement - I may try to get
a C++ compile out of this.
