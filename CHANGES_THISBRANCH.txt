CHANGES:
=================
Created /src/system,
for all system-specific
stuff. Involved moving
all of the i_* files
to that folder, and created
sub-folders for Windows,
MacOSX, linux, sega, and
openbsd.

*Reflected changes in all
source files.

Maybe we should make this a flag
or something, so that if it sets
the flag to MSC_VER or WIN32, that
it will automagically point to the 
correct subfolder? Maybe not. :/

========================================
/md5_conv/kmq2 files:

byteorder.h
hunk.h
q2limits.h

----> Moved to epi/ as:

epi_q2byteorder.h
epi_quake2hunk.h
epi_quake2limits.h

C files in that -> .cc files
all moved to epi/

epi_q2byteorder.cc
epi_quake2hunk.cc
epi_quake2stuff.cc

========================================
Created /src/Games, for all
GAME_SPECIFIC info. So far,
rott_* and wolf3d* have been
moved in that folder, reflected
in CMAKELISTS.txt.

========================================
Moved /opllib to src/opllib,
modified CMAKELISTS to point
to new folder.
