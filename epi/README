EPI Library V2.0

This is a general purpose library written in C++, but with no
reliance on templates and other advanced C++ features. The
intention is a lightweight lib biases towards use in game engines.

This version of EPI is much improved over the previous EPI V1.0,
which was included in the original EDGE. 

Please refer to INSTALL for installation instructions.
