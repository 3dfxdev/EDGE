EPI Library V3.0

This is a general purpose library written in C++. The
intention is a lightweight lib biased towards use in 
game engines. V1 and V2 did not rely on advancements
such as templates, but V3 does indeed include support
for dynamic array templates.

This version of EPI is much improved over the previous EPI V2,
which was included with versions of EDGE after 2.0. EPI V1.0
was conceived and developed by the original EDGE team (in 2004).

Please refer to INSTALL for installation instructions.
