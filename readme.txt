***********************************************
Version 1.36.2 - TEST - 
***********************************************

Release Notes:

-  FULL compatibility with EDGE mods now. 

-  This version is a "clean" copy from the official
   final 1.35 release. As such, some of the minor
   additions from 0.35d are not working.

-  Networking stuff has been added in for debugging. 
   *All viable netcode has been disabled for this test!

-  MD3 Support! Syntax is the same as MD2, with the
   exception - lump/file name should be xMD3 instead
   of xMD2 (where 'x' is the name).
   Limitations: single-mesh support only, working on
   full support.


SETUP:
*************
1) Place IWAD into port directory 
(IWAD can be doom, doom2, tnt, plutonia, hacx)

2) Run EDGE2.EXE and blast away!

in the readme might be deprecated in the future. 

However,it contains important setup information that you should
