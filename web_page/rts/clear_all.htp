<h3 class="page_title"> #CLEAR_ALL </h3>

<b>Description:</b><br>
It clears all scripts that are contained within the DOOM or DOOM2 game 
that might mess up your map and script.
For example, DOOM2 MAP07's functions that lower the four outer walls 
and raise the exit step being triggered by certain monsters deaths probably 
wouldn't be good to have if MAP07 in your TC doesn't need this effect.

<p>
Note: if you put #CLEAR_ALL in the middle of your script, all scripts above this point will be cleared. 
For this reason it should be placed at the top of your script.
