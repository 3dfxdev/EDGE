<p>

Anims.ddf allows you to change floor and ceiling animation or wall animation sequences. Each entry consists of a unique name, enclosed in square brackets, plus a series of commands that specify the first and last frames of the animation, as well as how frequently it changes.
<P>
Names should be descriptive, but are used in the map editor when adding animations to your maps, so should be no longer than 8 characters (without spaces).

<p>
The commands used for animation entries are as follows:
<p>


<TABLE class="cmds" BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2>
<TR><TH><B>COMMAND</B></TH><TH><B>TYPE</B></TH><TH><B>EXPLANATION</B></TH></TR>

<TR><TD>TYPE</TD><TD>[special] </TD><TD>
Either 'FLAT' for a floor texture animation, or 'TEXTURE' for a wall
texture animation.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>FIRST</TD><TD>[string]</TD><TD>
The first texture in the animation -- Refer to name of entry in wadfile.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>LAST</TD><TD>[string]</TD><TD>
The last texture in the animation -- Refer to name of entry in wadfile.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>SPEED</TD><TD>[time] </TD><TD>
The time to display each frame in tics(T). Where 8T is normal Doom speed and 4T is double normal speed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>SEQUENCE</TD><TD>[string] </TD><TD>
Use it to specify the full animation sequence.  Names cannot be used twice.  <br>For example: SEQUENCE = TEX1, TEX2, TEX3, TEX5, TEX8;
</TD></TR>


</TABLE>
&nbsp
<p>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>NOTES</font></b>
<p>
The full animation sequence consists of all the flats / textures
in the WAD file between the first and last entry.
<P>
You should make sure that you don't muddle up your entries in the wad. 
<p>
E.g 
<br>
MYANIMA
<br>
MYANIMB<br>
MYANIMC

<p>
 rather than 
<P>
MYANIMB
<br>
MYANIMA
<br>
MYANIMC
<p>
If you don't do your flats/ textures properly, EDGE will give you an
error message.
<P>


</font>

<P>
You can also use quotes around names with an underscore in it:<BR>

<PRE>	[MY_ANIM]
        TYPE  = FLAT;
	FIRST = "MY_AN_1";
	LAST  = "MY_AN_2";
	SPEED = 8T;
</PRE>

If you leave out the quotes, DDF converts an underscore to a space, so the
name MY_AN_1 would be read as "MY AN 1". The other obvious solution is to
never use an underscore in texture names you plan on animating.

<p>
<B>Example:</B><br>

The following are examples of complete animation entries:

<PRE class="ddf">
[NUKAGE1]
TYPE = FLAT; // floor or ceiling animation
SPEED = 8T;
SEQUENCE = "NUKAGE1", "NUKAGE2", "NUKAGE3";

[WALL_BLUE]
TYPE = TEXTURE; // wall animation
SPEED = 8T;
SEQUENCE = "BLUEY1", "BLUEY2", "BLUEY3";
</PRE>
