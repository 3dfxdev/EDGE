Sounds.ddf allows you to change the various sounds that are played as things happen in the game. Each entry consists of a unique name, enclosed in square brackets, plus a series of commands that specify the sound lump in the wadfile and the characteristics of how it's played.
<p>
Names should be descriptive of what the sound is and/or when it is used, and will be referred to in the other ddf files, such as weapons.ddf, attacks.ddf and things.ddf amongst others.

The commands used for sound entries are as follows:
<p>

<TABLE class="cmds" BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2>
<TR><TH>COMMAND</TH><TH>TYPE</TH><TH>DESCRIPTION</TH></TR>

<TR><TD>LOOP</TD><TD>[boolean]</TD><TD>
Makes the sound play over and over again. The only place where this is
important is in sector moving, or when creating an ambient
sound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>LUMP_NAME</TD><TD>[lumpname]</TD><TD>
The name of the SFX lump in the wad file. Sound lumps usually start with
"DS", which must be included. </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>MAX_DISTANCE</TD><TD>[float]</TD><TD>
The maximum distance away from the sound where it can still be heard.
Used to make sounds that can only be heard when the player is close to
the source. </td></tr>

<TR><TD>PRECIOUS</TD><TD>[boolean]</TD><TD>
When TRUE, this sound would rather to keep playing instead of being
cut (by an equal priority or equal singularity sound).  Default is
FALSE.</td></tr>

<TR><TD>PRIORITY</TD><TD>[integer]</TD><TD>
Specifies how important the sound is. Lower priorities are more
important. If a sound channel cannot be found to play the sound on,
EDGE will look for a channel playing a less important sound and cut
it. 0 means the sound has highest priority, 255 means sound has lowest
priority.
<BR>(NOTE: this strange priority scheme may be fixed is a future
release of EDGE).</td></tr>


<TR><TD>SINGULAR</TD><TD>[integer]</TD><TD>
If a thing is making a noise with the same singularity it will be cut.
(See chainsaw).</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>VOLUME</TD><TD>[percentage]</TD><TD>
Sound volume</TD></TR>
