<use synopsis file="attacks.ddf" lump="DDFATK" tag="ATTACKS">


Attacks.ddf allows you to define and modify all weapon and creature attacks in EDGE, as well as using them for ejecting shell cases, or spawning gibs. Each entry consists of a unique name, enclosed in square brackets, plus a series of commands that specify the type and characteristics of the attack.
<p>

The attack name should be descriptive of what it does and/or who uses it, and is referred to in the weapons.ddf and things.ddf files.
<p>
There are three general types of attacks. Closecombat
attacks (e.g punch, beserk, chainsaw), bullet attacks (e.g chaingun,
pistol etc) and projectile attacks (plasma, bfg, rockets, many monster
attacks). There are a number of other attacks too, which are normally associated with specific
monsters (e.g archvile flames, lost souls, mancubus attacks). Anyway,
if you want to create the world's coolest flamethrower, this is the
place to start!

<p>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>COMMANDS</font></b>
<p>
The commands used for attack entries are as follows:
<p>


<TABLE class="cmds" BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2>
<tr><th>COMMAND</th><th>TYPE</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr>

<tr><td>ACCURACY_ANGLE</td><td>[float]</td><td>
How accurate the attack is across the horizontal plane. The value is an angle.</td></tr>

<tr><td>ACCURACY_SLOPE</td><td>[float]</td><td>
How accurate the attack is over the vertical plane. The value is an angle.</td></tr>

<tr><td>ACTIVE_SOUND</td><td>[sound]</td><td>
The sound to make while a projectile is in flight.</td></tr>

<tr><td>ANGLE_OFFSET</td><td>[integer]</td><td>
Angles an attack in the horizontal plane. +ve values send the attack right, while -ve values send it left. E.g a value of 45 will make
your attack fly off 45 degrees to your right hand side.</td></tr>

<tr><td>ASSAULT_SPEED</td><td>[integer]</td><td>
Used for <A HREF="#skullfly">SKULLFLY</A> attacks -- the speed at
which the skull will fly.</td></tr>

<tr><td>ATTACK_CLASS</td><td>[bitset]</td><td>
Give an attack a certain class. Only useful in conjunction with IMMUNITY_CLASS in Things.ddf
<BR>There are 26 possible classes, A thru Z.
Three are reserved: `M' is the default for missile
attacks, `B' is the default ATTACK_CLASS for
bullet/shot attacks, and `C' is the default for
close-combat attacks.
<br>Examples:
<br>ATTACK_CLASS=U; or ATTACK_CLASS=UV;
</td></tr>

<tr><td>ATTACK_HEIGHT</td><td>[float]</td><td>
How high above the attacking creature the attack is. If it is 0, the
attack will come from the creature's foot, so it is generally a good
idea to make it bigger. Most DOOM creatures have this set at
32.</td></tr>

<tr><td>ATTACK_SPECIAL</td><td><A HREF="#attackspec">[flags]</A></td><td>
Flags for this attack.</td></tr>

<tr><td>ATTACKRANGE</td><td>[integer]</td><td>
The target must be inside this fixed range, or the attacking creature
won't bother shooting, but will attempt to get closer. In player
weapon attacks, this is used for autoaim purposes. (removing this value will
permanently disable autoaim on that weapon) Close attacks must have an
ATTACKRANGE to work properly. Make sure the attackrange is greater
than the creature's radius.</td></tr>

<tr><td>ATTACKTYPE</td><td><A HREF="#attacktypes">[special]</A></td><td>
The type of attack this is, eg close combat, projectile etc</td></tr>

<tr><td>ATTEMPT_SOUND</td><td>[sound]</td><td>
The sound to make just an attack is launched.</td></tr>

<tr><td>BERSERK_MULTIPLY</td><td>[float]</td><td>
How much this attack is improved by picking up a Berserk pack.</td></tr>

<tr><td>BOUNCE_SPEED</td><td>[float]</td><td>
Value which sets how much a projectile will bounce off walls. 1 never
loses speed, 0 completely stops, 0.5 loses 50% speed each time it
bounces.</td></tr>

<tr><td>DAMAGE.DEATH_STATE</td><td>[STATE]</td><td>
The custom states to be used (defined in things.ddf) when this attack causes the death of a creature. Ideal for having a flamethrower attack which sets the monster on fire!
<br>Example of use: In the attack you have DAMAGE.DEATH_STATE=BURNKILL and in your monsters DDF entry you create a STATES(BURNKILL)=.....  with some burning monsters sprites.</td></tr>

<tr><td>DAMAGE.ERROR</td><td>[float]</td><td>
When combined with the DAMAGE.VAL command this forces the attack damage to be calculated on a weighted average basis in the range from (DAMAGE.VAL - DAMAGE.ERROR) to (DAMAGE.VAL + DAMAGE.ERROR). The value for DAMAGE.ERROR should be less than the value for DAMAGE.VAL otherwise this won't work properly.</td></tr>

<tr><td>DAMAGE.MAX</td><td>[float]</td><td>
When combined with the DAMAGE.VAL command this forces the attack damage to be calculated in the range from DAMAGE.VAL to DAMAGE.MAX. The value for DAMAGE.MAX should be more than the value for DAMAGE.VAL otherwise this won't work.</td></tr>

<tr><td>DAMAGE.OVERKILL_STATE&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>[STATE]</td><td>
The custom states to be used (defined in things.ddf) when this attack causes overkill to a creature.</td></tr>

<tr><td>DAMAGE.PAIN_STATE</td><td>[STATE]</td><td>
The custom states to be used (defined in things.ddf) when this attack causes pain to a creature.</td></tr>

<tr><td>DAMAGE.VAL</td><td>[float]</td><td>
On it's own this command sets a fixed amount of damage done by the attack. It can also be combined with either the DAMAGE.MAX or DAMAGE.ERROR commands to allow a range of possible damage values.</td></tr>


<tr><td>DEATH_SOUND</td><td>[sound]</td><td>
The sound played when the projectile explodes.</td></tr>


<tr><td>DLIGHT.COLOUR</td><td>[special]</td><td>
This value is the colour to use for any dynamic lighting associated with the projectile. It's value takes the form of three pairs of digits in hexadecimal E.g. #RRGGBB to specify the proportion of each of the three colours in the mix. So for example #FF0000 would be pure red, #990000 would be a darker red and #FFFFFF would be a bright white. Experimentation is probably the best way to find the colour you want.</td></tr>

<tr><td>DLIGHT.INTENSITY</td><td>[float]</td><td>
This value is the starting dynamic light intensity of the projectile. This can be modified as the projetile moves using the <a href="#dlight">DLIGHT</a> SET and FADE actions.</td></tr>


<tr><td>DLIGHT.TYPE</td><td>[special]</td><td>
This value is the type of dynamic lighting to use for the projectile. At present only QUADRATIC lighting is known about, though there may be others.</td></tr>

<tr><td>ENGAGED_SOUND</td><td>[sound]</td><td>
The sound to make when attacking.</td></tr>

<tr><td>EXPLODE_DAMAGE.ERROR</td><td>[float]</td><td>
Same as DAMAGE.ERROR, except for explosion damage rather than ordinary attack damage..</td></tr>

<tr><td>EXPLODE_DAMAGE.MAX</td><td>[float]</td><td>
Same as DAMAGE.MAX, except for explosion damage rather than ordinary attack damage..</td></tr>

<tr><td>EXPLODE_DAMAGE.VAL</td><td>[float]</td><td>
Same as DAMAGE.VAL, except for explosion damage rather than ordinary attack damage..</td></tr>

<tr><td>EXPLODE_RADIUS</td><td>[float]</td><td>
Normally the explosion radius is the same as the damage caused, but this command forces the explosion radius to a particular value (e.g. 200).  The amount of damage is not affected.</td></tr>


<tr><td>FAST</td><td>[float]</td><td>
The attack speed will be multiplied by this value in nightmare mode or
when using -fastparm from the command line. Therefore, if speed=2,
this will make that attack twice as fast as normal if you play in
nightmare mode.</td></tr>

<tr><td>FUSE</td><td>[time]</td><td>
For projectile weapons only. Projectiles will explode on contact with
an object, or after the fuse time has elapsed. Hence, can be used to
limit the distance projectiles can travel. The time can be specified
in seconds or tics (e.g to make the projectile explode after two
seconds, set this value to 2 or 70T).</td></tr>

<tr><td>HEIGHT</td><td>[float]</td><td>
The height of the projectile.</td></tr>

<tr><td>KEEP_FIRING_CHANCE </td><td>[percentage]</td><td>
Specifies the chance that a creature using this attack will keep
firing as opposed to finding a better spot/moving etc.</td></tr>

<tr><td>LAUNCH_SOUND</td><td>[sound]</td><td>
The sound to play when the projectile is launched.</td></tr>

<tr><td>LIFESPAN</td><td>[time]</td><td>
Another word for FUSE (see above).</td></tr>

<TR><TD>MASS</TD><TD>[float]</TD><TD>
How heavy this projectile is. (E.g heavy objects won't be shoved around or tossed into the air by explosions. Used primarily for boss brain spawn cube projectiles.</TD></TR>

<tr><td>NO_TRACE_CHANCE</td><td>[percentage]</td><td>
Specifies the chance that a homing missile will lock onto target. 0% is lock every time, 100% is fail every time.</td></tr>

<tr><td><A href="#projspec">PROJECTILE_SPECIAL</a></td><td>[flags]</td><td>
Flags that should be added to a missile.</td></tr>

<tr><td>PUFF</td><td>[special]</td><td>
The name of an animation to play when a bullet weapon strikes a wall.
(this must be defined in things.ddf) Hence, different puff animations
can be created for different weapons.  If you set a rocket or other
projectile as `smoking', the puff animation is used as a smoke trail.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>RADIUS</td><td>[float]</td><td>
The radius of the projectile.</td></tr>

<tr><td>REACTIONTIME</td><td>[time]</td><td> ??? Used for boss brain spawn cube attack in DDF 3.7.</td></tr>

<tr><td>SHOTCOUNT</td><td>[integer]</td><td>
Determines the actual number of bullets fired when you use a bullet
weapons. For instance, the shotguns use a high shotcount value. Note,
this value does <B>not</B> effect how much ammo each weapon
uses.</td></tr>

<tr><td>SLOPE_OFFSET</td><td>[integer]</td><td>
Changes vertical angle of attack (up or down). Good for giving
grenades a realistic arc.</td></tr>

<TR><TD>SPARE_ATTACK</TD><TD>[attack]</TD><TD>
Default attack to use when the SPARE_ATTACK action is called from the STATES.</TD></TR>

<tr><td>SPAWN_OBJECT_STATE</td><td><A HREF="#spawn">[special]</A></td><td>
Sets the state that the spawned object will be spawned in (e.g chase,
spawn or attack state) </td></tr>

<tr><td>SPAWNED_OBJECT</td><td><A HREF="#spawn">[special]</A></td><td>
Object that is generated by a spawn attack. Must be the name of an
object defined in things.ddf</td></tr>

<TR><TD>SPAWNHEALTH</TD><TD>[float]</TD><TD>
The amount of health this object begins with. Used for boss brain spawn cube.</TD></TR>

<tr><td>SPEED</td><td>[float]</td><td>
How fast the spawned object moves. Values from 0 to 100 will work.
Most doom projectile attacks are of a speed between 20-30. High values
can make projectiles behave strangely.</td></tr>

<TR><TD>SPRITE_ASPECT</TD><TD>[float]</TD><TD>
Alters the aspect ratio of the projectiles graphic by affecting the horizontal image size. Values beween 0 and 1 make the object look narrower, whereas values above 1 make it look fatter.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>SPRITE_SCALE</TD><TD>[float]</TD><TD>
Alters the size of the projectiles graphic. Values beween 0 and 1 make the object look smaller, whereas values above 1 make it look bigger. Much bigger!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>STEP_SIZE</TD><TD>[float]</TD><TD>
Used for bouncing projectiles in QDoom. ??</TD></TR>

<tr><td>TOO_CLOSE_RANGE</td><td>[integer]</td><td>
The attacking creature won't use this attack if the target is inside
this range. Used if this is a ranged attack and the creature should
close for a close combat attack.</td></tr>

<tr><td>TRANSLUCENCY</td><td>[percentage]</td><td>
Specifies how translucent the missile is.. 100% is invisible, whereas 0% is completely solid.</td></tr>


<tr><td>X_OFFSET</td><td>[integer]</td><td>
Normally attacks are spawned from the centre of the attacking
creature. Positive values shift the attack to the right, negative to
the left. If you set the offset too wide for player attacks,
projectiles and/or shots can be absorbed by nearby walls, objects
etc.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Y_OFFSET</td><td>[integer]</td><td>
Similar to X_OFFSET, but moves an attack forwards or backwards
relative to the target. Positive is forwards, negative is
backwards.</td></tr>


</TABLE>


&nbsp
<p>

<p>
<A NAME="states">
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>STATES</B></FONT>
<p>
Each named STATES entry defines an animation sequence to play when an attack is in progress, as well as calling the actions required at the appropriate frames in the animation. These consist of a series of states, which are individual frames of the animation. A state is defined like this:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>Sprite:Frame:Tics:Bright:Action</code>
<br>
as follows:
<p>
<TABLE class="misc" BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2>

<tr><td>Sprite</td><td>
The four letter name of the sprite to use.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Frame</td><td>
The frame reference, A-Z, '[', '\', ']' If you need more than this,
use another sprite.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Tics</td><td>
Number of tics to spend on this frame. -1 means the frame should last
forever.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Bright</td><td>
Can be 'BRIGHT' or 'NORMAL' Bright frames are always drawn full
brightness.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Action</td><td>
Action to be carried out. <a href="#actions">Actions</a> are listed below.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>


Each frame ends with either a semincolon <b>;</b> if it is the last frame in the animation or a comma <b>,</b> if it is not. 
<p>
In addition, any line may include a <tt>#Command</tt> at the end. This will either be <tt>#STATENAME</tt> which causes a jump to the first frame in the animation of the named state. <tt>#STATENAME:FRAME</tt> causing a jump to the specified frame number in the animation of the named state. OR <tt>#REMOVE</tt> to remove the animation shown from the HUD.
<p>

<p>
<A NAME="attacktypes"><B><FONT SIZE=+1>ATTACKTYPES</B></FONT></A>
<p>
In DDF, player and monster attacks are completely interchangeable. You
could make a Baron of Hell fire BFG blasts, the cyberdemon fire a
stream of plasma, and give yourself a homing rocket launcher to fight
back with. However, you cannot create new attack types, you can only
pick from the list of attack types below. 
<p>
<TABLE class="ddf" BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2>
<tr><th>TYPE</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr>

<tr><td>CLOSECOMBAT</td><td>
Any close combat attack, like the demon's bite, the baron's scratch,
or the chainsaw.</td></tr>

<tr><td>FIXED_SPREADER</td><td>

These are flags that are used to modify an attack in some way. <br>
 You can combine one or more terms as such
<br>
ATTACK_SPECIAL=NEED_SIGHT,FACE_TARGET;

<p>
<TABLE class="ddf" BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2>
<tr><th>SPECIAL</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr>

deserves.</td></tr>

<tr><td>NEED_SIGHT</td><td>
The attack will only take place if the attacker can see it's target.</td></tr>


<tr><td>NOTARGET</td><td>
The attack will NOT auto-aim. For object spawners (like the Pain
Elemental), the spawned things won't automatically hate the
player (or whatever their parent has a grudge against)</td></tr>

<tr><td>NO_TRIGGER_LINES</td><td>
This attack will not trigger any special linedef types it passes or strikes.</td></tr>

<p>
<TABLE class="ddf" BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2>
<tr><th>SPECIAL</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr>

<tr><td>BARE_MISSILE</td><td>
Identifies the projectile as a missile.</td></tr>

<tr><td>BOSSMAN</td><td>
Identifies the projectile as a bossman (e.g. boss brain spawn cube). Explosions do little damage and there is no volume change.</td></tr>

<tr><td>BOUNCE</td><td>
Object will bounce off walls and ceilings/floors, and enters BOUNCE
states too.</td></tr>

<tr><td>CROSSLINES</td><td>
Allows the projectile to travel over any line in a map. Main use is
for spawner attacks, so the spawned monsters can cross lines marked
'blockmonster' in a map editor. </td></tr>

<tr><td>DROPOFF</td><td>
Missiles can travel over cliffs (a cliff is any part of a map where
sector height varies by 32 units or so). Always specify this.</td></tr>

<tr><td>MISSILE</td><td>
Combination of MISSILE + CROSSLINES + NOFRICTION.</td></tr>

<tr><td>NOBLOCKMAP</td><td>
Allows projectiles to cross lines in a map (important!).</td></tr>

<tr><td>NOCLIP</td><td>
? - used in Qdoom</td></tr>

<tr><td>NOFRICTION</td><td>
Projectile is never slowed down by air or ground friction.</td></tr>

This means that projectiles are unaffected by gravity (e.g rockets
don't drop). Remove this setting from rocket attacks to make yourself
an instant grenade</td></tr>

<tr><td>NOSHADOW</td><td>
Projectile does not cast a shadow.</td></tr>

<tr><td>SLIDER</td><td>
Will make projectile slide when it hits a wall.</td></tr>

<tr><td>TUNNEL</td><td>
Missile can tunnel through enemies. Causes missiles to pass through enemies rather than blowing up on impact. Still damaging them though, but only once and then keep on going. Handy for a railgun.</td></tr>

<tr><td>WATERWALKER</td><td>
Projectile will not pass through liquid extrafloors.</td></tr>
