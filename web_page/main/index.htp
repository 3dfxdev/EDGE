<use BeginNews title="1.31 RC#1 Available" date="09-Jul-2008">

As always we are delighted to announce that EDGE 1.31-RC#1
is now available for download.
Since this is a Release Candidate (RC), it should be as
stable and complete as the full release, and we will not be
adding any new features now, only fixing bugs.

<p>
The biggest new feature is Lua-scripted HUDs, giving modders
great power to create new status bars and other Heads-Up-Display
elements.
Also worth noting are the new Detail Slopes, which are a bit
limited but good for adding some cool slopey details into your maps.

<p>
Many bugs have been fixed since Beta#2, for example:
colormapped sectors (blue water etc) are working again,
the Super Shotgun firing rate was too slow and has
been rectified, and Timidity music playback is now finished
and works well in both Linux and Windows.

<p>
Lastly, some things have been removed, such as
demo support and CD music playback,
because of difficult-to-fix bugs
and lack of interest in these features.

<use BeginNews title="Beta#2 Update" date="02-Feb-2008">

EDGE 1.31-Beta#2 has been updated to fix a fatal error
when saving a game, mainly when starting
the game from the new HOST-NET-GAME menu.

Another problem causing multiple popup dialogs
when the D: drive is a CDROM or DVD
should also be fixed.

<use BeginNews title="Beta#2 is Out" date="29-Jan-2008">

EDGE 1.31-Beta#2 is now available for download and testing.
This release updates to SDL 1.2.13 which fixes the sound
problem under Vista.

<p>
New features include support for 16-bit
sounds (WAV and OGG/Vorbis formats), music playback for Linux,
and an Invulnerability setting in the video options.

<p>
However the main thrust of this release is fixing bugs
(such as the messed up screen after changing resolution)
and other enhancements (like using MD2 frame names in DDF).
