<h1>Lua HUD Manual</h1>

by Andrew Apted. &nbsp; April 2008


<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>

Lua is a scripting language, which is quite easy to
learn even if you've never programmed before.
More information can be found here:
<a href="http://www.lua.org">
Lua home page</a>

<p>
EDGE looks for several lumps to load Lua scripts from.
Lumps called "LUAUTIL#" (where # is a digit) contain
utility code, useful stuff that is not HUD-related,
whereas lumps called "LUAHUD#" contain the code
for drawing the HUD (which is nearly everything on
the screen while the user is playing a level).

<p>
The following lumps are looked for (in the order listed) and
are loaded when present:

<center>
<table>
<tr>
  <td class="L1"><b>LUMP</b></td>
  <td class="L2"><b>&nbsp;Source</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="L1">LUAUTIL0</td>
  <td class="L2">&nbsp;from EDGE.WAD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="L1">LUAUTIL1</td>
  <td class="L2">&nbsp;from a TC/Mod</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="L1">LUAUTIL2</td>
  <td class="L2">&nbsp;from an Add-on</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td class="L1">LUAHUD0</td>
  <td class="L2">&nbsp;from EDGE.WAD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="L1">LUAHUD1</td>
  <td class="L2">&nbsp;from a TC/Project</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="L1">LUAHUD2</td>
  <td class="L2">&nbsp;from a Mod/Addon</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
The lumps ending with '0' are the ones in EDGE.WAD and should not be
replaced by custom pwads (especially LUAUTIL0 which has some important
house-keeping functions).
Lumps ending with '1' are for large projects and Total Conversions,
which generally have new maps, textures and monsters.
Lumps ending with '2' are for smaller mods/addons, stuff like new
weapons, which could be used in addition to a large project or TC.
