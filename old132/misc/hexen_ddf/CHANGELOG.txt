INTRODUCTION
============

Began creating these definitions for Hexen from scratch.
To keep these definitions under the GPL, I am *not* looking
at the Hexen source code at all.  Instead I'm using the
following resources:

1) the "Official Hexen Specs v1.0" by Ben Morris.
2) the "Hexen FAQ" by Arne Michaelsen.
3) examining the IWAD with tools, e.g. "lswad" and "deutex".
4) examining the levels the "Yadex" level editor.
5) playing the real game in DOS and noting discrepancies.

CHANGELOG
=========

2007-MAY-18:

Starting doing this for Hexen too, using the Heretic DDF
which I've already written as a basis.

Created ANIMS.DDF (flat/texture animations) based on the
flats/textures in the IWAD.

Created SWITCHES.DDF based on the SWxxx textures in the
IWAD (EDGE doesn't support the animations, only the off/on
states).

Created FONTS.DDF and modified STYLES.DDF to use it.


2007-MAY-19:

Update level definitions, grouping them into the five
clusters that Hexen uses, and gave each map the basic
SKY name (EDGE doesn't support the double sky feature).

Created initial THINGS.DDF using things that Hexen
shares with Heretic (some of the health and artifact
pickups).


2007-MAY-20:

Added entries for the keys.  At first I assumed the key
numbers (8030..8039) corresponded to the sprite names
(KEY1 .. KEY9, KEYA and KEYB), and judging by the sprites
this is correct (off by one), e.g. 8032 is definitely the
AXE key and 8035 is definitely the EMERALD key.  Assigned
each pickup item an EDGE key, e.g. STEEL key is an exact
match, whereas SWAMP KEY -> EDGE's WATER KEY, EMERALD KEY
to EDGE's GREEN_CARD, etc...

Added entries for mana (types 122,124 and 8004).  I don't
know yet how much they should give you.  AMMO1 is used
for blue mana and AMMO2 for green.

Added the following artifact entries, and noticed that
the Heretic MorphOvum has become the Porkulator in Hexen,
and the Ring-o-Invulnerability is now called the Icon of
the Defender, so and adjusted the entries accordingly.

  [Repulser_Disc:8000]  [Krater_of_Might:8003]
  [Speed_Boots:8002]    [Bracers:8041]
  [Mystic_Incant:10120] [Dark_Servant:86]
  [Flechette:10110]     [Banishment_Device:10040]

Note: none of these have any equivalent powerup in EDGE.

Added entries for the monsters.  They are not animated
however, so are like frozen in the level.

Noticed the CPS# sprites in the IWAD, obviously Corpses
of various kinds, so added entries for them to THINGS.DDF.

Noticed the TRE# sprites in the IWAD and added Tree
entries for them into THINGS.DDF.

Added Wall_Torch and Wall_Torch_Unlit things.
Added Twine_Torch and Twine_Torch_Unlit things.

Added Christmas_Tree, Crumple_Tree and Bell things.

Fixed up PLAYLIST.DDF using the info from the MAPINFO
lump extracted from the IWAD.

Added Wooden_Barrel thing (BARL:A).

Added Candles and Blue_Candle things (CNDL and CAND).
Added Chandelier (CDLR) thing and unlit version.


2007-MAY-21:

Added TSMK object (Teleport_Smoke).
Added FSKL object (Fire_Skull).

Added ICM# and ICT# objects (ice stalagmites and stalactites).
Added SGM# and SLC# things (cave stalagmites and stalactites).
Added RCK# things (Rocks).

Added CDRN (Cauldron) things.
Added FBUL (Fire_Bull) things.
Added BRTR (Brass_Torch) thing.

According to the Hexen specs, there are quite a few Gargoyle
sprites (using map ids 72-76 and 8044-8052).  Looking at the
IWAD, they must use sprites STT2-STT5 and GAR1-GAR9.  Added
entries for them, and also the Winged_Statue things and the
Suit_of_Armor.
