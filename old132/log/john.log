DOOMSTAT.H      /
V_VIDEO*.C      /
DJGPP/I_VIDEO.C - Fixed the problem with the global variables by removing
                  SCREENWMULTIPLIER, SCREENHMULTIPLIER etc. (Sorry Andy)
                  It display's properly again in higher resolutions.

                  Now uses vars : int DX,DXI,DY,DYI,DY2,DYI2;


                  Also in v_video1.c for some reason it was using Y Co-ords
                  for both x & y in the follwing :

                         V_DrawPatchInDirect8
                         V_DrawPatchInDirectFlipped8
                         V_DrawPatchShrink8
                         V_DrawPatchInDirectTrans8    (Why didn't I see it?)
                         V_DrawPatchInDirect8

                  Funnily enough they were correct in all the 16-bit
                  functions (v_video2.c).

DJGPP/I_ALLEGV.C /
M_MISC.C         /
M_OPTION.C     -  Added "No Vert" to the main option menu, "Vertical Retrace"
                  to the Video Menu. VRetrace stops the screen shearing.
                  (Both options are now saved into the DEFAULT.CFG file)

                  No Vert is only useful if you are like me and don't believe
                  in using MLOOK with Doom :)

                  Vertical Retrace will be overridden if the "-dblbuffer"
                  parameter is specified at the command line.

RAD_TRIG.C - (DoRadiTrigger)Fixed a bug which cause SpawnThing to crash. 
             Caused by items respawning without any thing info in mapthing_t.
R_MAIN.C   - (R_ExecuteViewSize) Now displays the status bar properly at
             any resolution (Looks good at 400x300 now).

Date: 21 May 1998 
Removed lastepisode var from game.c (not used anymore)
Finalised rad_trig.c

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 11 May 1998 
+ Added Radius_Trigger(TM) :) Scripting Language, with TIP handling functions.
  Files Added    : djgpp/rad_trig.c - Parser / Scripting Language / Trigger
                                      handler / Tip Processor
                   djgpp/rad_trig.h - Function Prototypes

  Files Modified : djgpp/d_main.c   (D_DoomMain)   -Script Loader/Parser
                   djgpp/p_user.c   (P_PlayerThink)-Trigger Event Handler Call
                   djgpp/hu_stuff.c (HU_Drawer)    -Tip Event Handler Call
                   djgpp/g_game.c   
                       + Added lastmap var(global) to accomodate the script
                         function GOTO_MAP <mapno>, ensures map names are
                         displayed correctly. (Used in function G_DoLoadLevel)
                       (G_DoReborn)
                       (G_Ticker) - No also resets/restarts radius triggers
                                    depending on whether the player has died,
                                    gone to a new level or is playing a
                                    netgame.

+ Some code cleanup.
                   djgpp/r_things.c (R_DrawVisSprite)
                                    - Commented out a block of code which is
                                      now irrelevant. To render a translated
                                      player the engine relies on the playxtra
                                      var to contain the palette translation
                                      offset multiplier.
                   djgpp/p_mobj.c   (P_SpawnPlayer)
                                    - Reworked most of the code. It should
                                      be easier to understand and now just
                                      sets playxtra to define the players
                                      translation colours.
                   djgpp/g_game.c   (G_CheckDemoStatus)
                                    - Rolled up code which set playersingame
                                      1..MAXPLAYERS to 0;
                                    (G_DoNewGame)
                                    - Same as previous entry.
                   djgpp/d_net.c    (D_TryRunTics)
                                    - I misunderstood the original code
                                      thinking it did something else (when
                                      I was figuring out the 8 player stuff
                                      back in the CTFDoom days :) ).
                                      So the old code has been put back in.
                   djgpp/hu_stuff.c (HU_Drawer)
                                    - Show info cheat shows the x & y co-ords
                                      normally rather than a fixed point
                                      number. Will make it easier when using
                                      the Radius Triggers when finding
                                      coordinates.
