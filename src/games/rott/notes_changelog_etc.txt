Rise of the Triad port to 3DGE
based upon the Wolf3D 3DGE code:
------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION OF FILE LIST:

rott_maps.cc -> RTL map format.


random notes:
FL_ (map flags, in 3DGE these are MPF_)
**** :first seen in rt_def.h

The FLIC file formats most known in the extension .FLI and .FLC, used to store animation files.

typedef struct {
    int x, y, dir;
} _2dvec;
**** _2dvec is vec2_t in 3DGE

WAD handling can be done using w_Wad.cc

Patch decoding can be done using 3DGE's internal patch headers.
