This library is created to translate ROTT datas in 3DGE, with a few key differences (all actor/line/etc is all DDF now, obviously).

This is in the very early stages and for now, is only skeletal. It is based on 3DGE's Wolf3D interpreter.

Files:
rott_data: all ROTT Specific data is defined here.

rott_defs: all global defines are located here.
