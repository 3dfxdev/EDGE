SPLINES LIBRARY -> 3DGE
=======================
All Splines math code needs translating to epi:: math code,
since this project will be a core part of 3DGE, and thus, I
can't just stick the stupid LIB into the project. 

Things to note:

All the MATH_ code: needs to use EPI/MATH_ code
ALL q_ code: needs to use local defines in /src
ALL the UTIL_ code: needs to use EPI utilitiy code
 ^ util_list, util_str


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
First, we *WILL* try the LIB method of linking
Splines.lib into the project. This way, we can just use its
functions directly. Tired of this shit.
