// Officially, to be more SDL-like, we ought to arrange our structures with particular alignment,
// specify C-style linkage, etc.  I don't think that's important at this point, but should anyone be
// deranged enough to detach SDL_netx from Aleph One and position it as a real extension to SDL_net,
// these things should be investigated.


// SDLNetx_EnableBroadcast - allow SDLNetx_UDP_Broadcast to succeed on inSocket
//   inputs: UDPsocket inSocket - socket for which broadcasting should be enabled
//   outputs: return value - positive if broadcasting was enabled; 0 if not
int	SDLNetx_EnableBroadcast(UDPsocket inSocket);

// SDLNetx_DisableBroadcast - disallow SDLNetx_UDP_Broadcast to succeed on inSocket
//   inputs: UDPsocket inSocket - socket for which broadcasting should be disabled
//   outputs: return value - positive if broadcasting was disabled; 0 if not
int	SDLNetx_DisableBroadcast(UDPsocket inSocket);


// SDLNetx_UDP_Broadcast - attempt to send inPacket to the broadcast address of each available
//     interface in the system capable of IP (UDP) broadcast.
//   inputs: UDPsocket inSocket - the socket that should send the broadcast packet.  You should have
//              already called EnableBroadcast() on it.  Note that any "channels" are ignored here.
//           UDPpacket* inPacket - packet which should be broadcast.  The host-part of the address is ignored;
//              the port-part is used.
//   outputs: return value - number of interfaces packet was broadcast on; 0 if not broadcast
//            inPacket->status - status result of the broadcast Send call on the last interface
