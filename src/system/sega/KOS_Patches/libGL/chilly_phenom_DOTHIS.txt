When I talked to Phenom about the memory usage for kgl, he recommended
decreasing the number of vertexes in the buffer. He said that 64K was
total overkill, so I bumped it down to 16K, 1/4 the amount of space.
That freed up about 1.5 MB. I was able to play through 4 levels of
Doom just fine.

To do that (after you've got the toolchain done and kos-ports
compiled), CD to the libgl directory and do

make fetch unpack

Then alter gl_pvr.h - find this line

#define GL_KOS_MAX_VERTS       1024*64    /* SH4 Vertex Count */

and change it to

#define GL_KOS_MAX_VERTS       1024*16    /* SH4 Vertex Count */

Coralines Note:

You might need to do a 'make uninstall clean' first, then 'make fetch unpack',
go into /libGL/build/libGL-2.0.0, edit gl_pvr.h to the specifications outlined
above, _THEN_ go into libGL root, then 'make install clean' -- it should compile
after that with the new libGL.a, which then can be linked against SLaVE with the
vertex count lowered.
