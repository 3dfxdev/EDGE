ENet 1.2 (February 12, 2008):

* fixed bug in VERIFY_CONNECT acknowledgement that could cause connect
attempts to occasionally timeout
* fixed acknowledgements to check both the outgoing and sent queues
when removing acknowledged packets
* fixed accidental bit rot in the MSVC project file
* revised sequence number overflow handling to address some possible
disconnect bugs
* added enet_host_check_events() for getting only local queued events
* factored out socket option setting into enet_socket_set_option() so
that socket options are now set separately from enet_socket_create()

Caveats: While this release is superficially protocol compatible with 1.1,
differences in the sequence number overflow handling can potentially cause
random disconnects.

ENet 1.1 (June 6, 2007):

* optional CRC32 just in case someone needs a stronger checksum than UDP 
provides (--enable-crc32 configure option)
* the size of packet headers are half the size they used to be (so less 
overhead when sending small packets)
* enet_peer_disconnect_later() that waits till all queued outgoing 
packets get sent before issuing an actual disconnect
* freeCallback field in individual packets for notification of when a 
packet is about to be freed
* ENET_PACKET_FLAG_NO_ALLOCATE for supplying pre-allocated data to a 
packet (can be used in concert with freeCallback to support some custom 
allocation schemes that the normal memory allocation callbacks would 
normally not allow)
* enet_address_get_host_ip() for printing address numbers
* promoted the enet_socket_*() functions to be part of the API now
* a few stability/crash fixes
