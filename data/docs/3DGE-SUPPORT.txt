3DGE 2.1.0
======================
SUPPORT
======================
As mentioned in the Readme, contained is a helpful
guide on some of the most common troubleshooting
questions. If this does not solve your problem
after reading all of the technical documents, please
report these issues at http://edge2.sf.net

======================

Troubleshooting:
  - If EDGE crashes, or otherwise misbehaves, please help us by
    reporting the problem.  To do this check out the EDGE website at
    http://edge2.sourceforge.net.  We appreciate input because if you
    don't tell us about a bug, we can't deal with it.

  - Post the EDGE2.LOG file which EDGE creates along with your bug
    report, as this contains lots of useful information to help us
    track down the problem.

  - Mods designed for EDGE 1.35 and lower will no longer run out-of-box
    since their version directive is too low - use the command line args
    -v135 or -v129 for those. We will not help getting older mods running
    in 3DGE 2.1+, so you run these at your own risk.

  For Windows:
    - Please make sure you meet or exceed the SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

    - For EDGE to "work", you need a 3D card *plus* OpenGL drivers for
      it installed on your computer.  A really low framerate (1 FPS)
      usually means that the *software* OpenGL driver is being used (not
      what we want).  Go to the website of your card's
      manufacturer and look for a recent 3D driver.  Another place to
      look is on Microsoft's site.  Basically, if Quake 3 (or some
      other OpenGL game) works, then EDGE should work too.

    - GLSL is now supported in 3DGE, but if you notice really low framerates,
      look at 3DGE-CVARS.txt and disable the shader features. A command-line
      switch is being implemented to disable the system before the engine is
      started for users who want to force that. If your hardware does not support
      GLSL, it will be disabled automatically. GLSL shaders can be used with
      both OpenGL 1.1 and OpenGL 3 modes.

  For Linux:

    - You can check whether hardware 3D rendering is available by
      running the 'glxinfo' program in an terminal, and look for the
      line which says "direct rendering: Yes".
