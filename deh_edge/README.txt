DEH_EDGE
========

by Andrew Apted.  16th January 2004.


Introduction
------------

Deh_edge is a utility for converting DeHackEd (.DEH) files into something
that can be loaded into the EDGE engine (http://edge.sourceforge.net).
The output is a WAD containing a bunch of DDF lumps.

Deh_edge is a command line utility, so the Windows version must be run
from the DOS box.


Usage
-----

Run it like this:

   deh_edge batman.deh

which will create the file "batman_deh.wad". 


Options
-------

  -o    gives the output file.  Optional.  The default output
        filename is the DEH filename with the extension removed
        and "_deh.wad" added.
