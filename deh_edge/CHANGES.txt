CHANGELOG
=========

Changes in V1.3  (Unreleased)
-----------------------------

 - handle header-less text patch files (BEX), in order to be
   compatible with BOOM (and probably other source ports).

 - workaround for negative mass values (put on the ceiling).

 - added MacOS X support.


Changes in V1.2  (23rd September 2004)
--------------------------------------

 - support for "DIE" action (Boom/MBF), available in Edge 1.29.

 - interface for embedding into other programs (especially a DDF
   based Doom game engine).  Just #include "dh_plugin.h".  Coded up
   support for progress notification.  Added support for parsing
   raw lumps.  Made sure the plugin can be used multiple times
   (without a previous run interfering with a later one).

 - replaced the --all option with something undocumented, since it
   gave the wrong impression (as if DEH_EDGE was leaving something
   out of the output file).


Changes in V1.1  (11th July 2004)
---------------------------------

 - added support for the extra BOOM/MBF things, states, sprites
   and sounds (e.g. the DOG).  Some of the new BOOM/MBF actions
   are converted to EDGE equivalents, other ones (which don't
   have any direct equivalent) are not yet implemented.

 - made the CAST screen robust: it would not work properly before
   when certain monsters lost their chase or death states.

 - added support for BEX (Boom Extensions): ".bex" filenames,
   allowing keywords on the BITS line, plus the following new
   sections: [CODEPTR], [STRINGS], [SOUNDS], [MUSIC], [SPRITES].
   The [PARS] and [HELPER] sections are recognised but ignored.


Changes in V1.0  (4th June 2004)
--------------------------------

 - multiple patches (even binary ones !).

 - new option --edge specifies which version of EDGE to target.

 - binary patch text replacements for DOOM 1.666 and 1.7.

 - improved things: add MONSTER flag using good statistical test,
   use FACE_TARGET for certain attacks, add CAST_TITLE if needed,
   write RESURRECT states when thing uses A_VileChase.

 - fixed bug not writing double quotes (") into LDF.

 - fixed problem not handling 0xFF bytes in cheat strings.


Changes in V0.9  (7th February 2004)
------------------------------------

 - Initial public release !

 - fixed bug not writing percent signs (%) for a few things.

 - improved system definitions in i_defs.h.

 - thing improvements: fixed handling of A_PainDie, A_KeenDie and
   A_BrainDie.  Support AMBUSH flag.  Handle cases where multiple
   attacks get used.  Better handling of pick-up items.  Added
   workaround for A_Look when there are no sight states.

 - general improvements to the weapon flash logic.


Changes in earlier versions (Never Released)
--------------------------------------------

 - new storage module, which remembers modifications.

 - thing improvements: fixed monster infighting.  Convert palette
   translations.  Workaround for LOST_SOUL without missile states.

 - better separation of weapon and thing actions.

 - proper handling of dependencies.

 - fixed WAD code which was broken for big endian CPUs.
