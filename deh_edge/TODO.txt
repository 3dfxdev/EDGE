DEH-EDGE TODO
-------------

-  implement these Boom/MBF actions:

   - A_Die : needs a new EDGE action.

   - A_Scratch : misc1 is damage, misc2 is optional failure sound.
                 may need to create custom attack(s).

   - A_Spawn : misc1 is MT_NUM (0 = NOP, otherwise subtract 1),
               misc2 is height above spawner's foot.

   - A_Mushroom : ideally need new EDGE action (AT LEAST: custom attack(s)).
                  mobjinfo[].damage determines number of FATSO missiles.
				  doesn't use misc1/misc2.

-  warn about ZDoom-specific stuff.
