DEH-EDGE TODO
-------------

*  Plugin: first use will modify tables, messing up subsequent uses.

+  Plugin: pass proper error values (and strings) when something
   goes wrong (e.g. wad save problem).

+  fix the way default output name is determined (for Plugin: don't
   have a default).

-  check that extension stuff (missing for input/output) still works.

-  implement these Boom/MBF actions:

   - A_Scratch : misc1 is damage, misc2 is scratch sound (0 for none).
                 need to a create custom attack for each use.
				 see [IMP_CLOSECOMBAT] for a guide.

   - A_Spawn : misc1 is MT_NUM (0 = NOP, otherwise subtract 1),
               misc2 is height above spawner's foot.
			   ideally need new EDGE action, otherwise either:
			   (a) use DROPITEM(FOO), or
			   (b) create a custom attack for each use (TYPE=SPAWNER).

   - A_Mushroom : ideally need new EDGE action (AT LEAST: custom attack(s)).
                  mobjinfo[].damage determines number of FATSO missiles.
				  doesn't use misc1/misc2.

   DONE: A_Die : needs a new EDGE action.

-  warn about ZDoom-specific actions/strings/etc.

DONE:  remove ticker() callback.
DONE:  progress callbacks.
