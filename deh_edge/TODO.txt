DEH-EDGE Todo
-------------

+  support multiple patches.

-  Mancubus attack busted.

-  versions of malloc and strdup that error out on no memory.

-  move GetSound into Sounds.cpp/h

-  frames: remove 'OutputState' (etc) from header file.

-  frames: for action warnings, show A_FooBar, not edge name.

DONE:  LOOKOUT with no seestate --> have STATES(CHASE) with #REMOVE.
DONE:  MF_AMBUSH is actually USED BY DOOM.
DONE:  A_KeenDie: if used in modified thing, output RSCRIPT lump.
DONE:  frames/things: A_KeenDie (ETC !) imply a MAKEDEAD.


FUTURE Plans
------------

-  support for BEX (Boom extensions).

-  support for Boom/MBF additional things/frames/etc.

-  option for EDGE version (e.g. -v128, --version 1.27).
