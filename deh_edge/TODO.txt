DEH-EDGE Todo
-------------

-  Mancubus attack busted.

-  versions of malloc and strdup that error out on no memory.

DONE:  patch: ReadBinarySound
DONE:  ELEMENTAL SPAWN attacks: don't work if LOST.SOUL loses missilestates.
DONE:  translation bits: PLAYER_DK_GREY, PLAYER_BROWN, PLAYER_DULL_RED


FUTURE Ideas
------------

-  option for EDGE version (e.g. -v128, --version 1.27).

-  support multiple (Diff-style) patches.
