CHANGELOG for EDGE 1.4 PROTOTYPE RELEASE (since 1.36)
====================================

(Date: September 2014)

This release is a stopgap to show new features and is the last in the 1.x codebase:

In the first step towards 3DGE 2.0, this release incorporates: 
+ rendering interpolation, though really unfinished (disable with r_lerp)
 - Currently, doors/lifts/misc remain hard-capped at 35hz
 -Interpolation throws as many frames up as possible, resulting in inconsistent framerate and no VSYNC
- Hardcoded fog (cannot disable)
- Splash screen is disabled
+ Almost all EDGE 1.32 code is removed
- Headbob is disabled in this release
+ Incorporated Splines lib
+ MD5 backend code lib
+ Quaternion support in EPI: /epi (math_quaternions), used for interpolation, MD5, and Splines
