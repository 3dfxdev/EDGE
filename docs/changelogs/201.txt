CHANGELOG for EDGE 2.0.1 (since 2.0.0)
====================================

(Date: June 2015)


+ MD2/MD3/MD5/MDL models now display with Masked Blending (all of the time),
  so now both sides of a 3D model can be viewed without the backface being
  culled (front-face culling for mirrors is still active). Expensive, 
  but now two-sided models can be rendered. This will eventually become 
  a flag in DDF (MaskBlend in SPECIAL) to allow per-model control rather 
  than the entire model rendering system, in case there are special models
  that don't require two-sided faces.

+ Bobbing is restored in the source code. No need to tinker with the 
  BOBBING= setting, though restoring Bobbing introduces hindered interpolation
  (if r_lerp set to "1"). 2.0.2 will have interpolated head bob. You can adjust
  the bobbing COMMAND to make it less or more severe, depending on your taste.

+ COAL: Added multiple HUDS for DOOM - now you can choose between the classic HUD,
  no HUD, or the 3DGE HUD (improved with on-screen ammo counts). Just toggle between
  them with the +/- keys.

+ Fixed classic DOOM HUD causing weapon to be vertically "squished".

+ Support for FreeDoom Phase 1 and 2 IWADS (freedoom1.wad and freedoom2.wad) and the Chex IWAD. 

+ DDF: Vastly improved Styles.DDF Support (allows MENU/OPTIONS/etc. customizations): can customize
  RTS_MENU now with an animation or graphic. Able to call Anims.DDF through COAL and RTS, 
  Anims.DDF has been improved.

+ DDF: Smoother weapon state ticrates (0.0f), however this is untested.

+ BOOM: Working on more generalised linetype compatibility issues. For now I am adding the linetypes into LINES.DDF as I go.

+ Fixed a bug with the Quit screen rendering all black instead of transparent.

+ Fixed a bug with SpiderDemon and CyberDemon's Walk sounds (METAL/HOOF) not being audible.

+ Removed Dehacked version checking in DEH_edge - now, any kind of DEH should load.

+ Splashscreen can be enabled with a commandline option (-showsplash); disabled by default.

+ HERETIC: New heads-up display, working on writing the default HUD, but for now Heretic users
 can use the streamlined HUD overlay. Integrated patch graphics for the main menu (temporary 
 until menu_strings get implemented). The HUD is not in herddf, but in HERFIX.WAD.

Prototypes added:

* Custom SWIM states for monsters

* Custom ON_CONDITION states for MOBJS (to control through RTS)

* Stencil Buffer added to 3DGE (drawplane reflections for water/etc)

* Bounding Box Upgrades (simple directional physics using lightweight library)

* Caustics on walls

+ Beginning of Half-Life MDL format support (bones, skeletal)

+ Restored DrawLaser in r_Render.cc for eventual laser rendering

+ Fixed MD5 scale and rotation, working on skin_img support

+ Player 2 Input (rework)

+ Start of Decal code (using the Stencil Buffer). 

REMOVED:
+ Action keys 3 + 4 (debugging)
