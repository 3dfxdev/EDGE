CHANGELOG FOR 1.29 (since 1.28)
===============================

(Date: OCTOBER 30th 2004)


Bugs fixed
----------

+ crash loading a savegame with dynamic lights when D/L disabled.

- Arch-vile no longer resurrects monsters into itself.
- don't display "Entering" on intermission when map is last one.
- fix for ONCONDITION <weapon> in RTS scripts.
- fix for teleport on MAP06 (going to wrong place).
- boss brain can now be hurt from rocket explosions.
- quotes (") usable in response files (for filenames with spaces).
- DDF parser will catch angles > 360 degrees.
- watching a moving monster while dead is now smoother.
- allow KEY_GREENCARD and KEY_GREENSKULL in DDF.
- texture vertical mis-alignment in some rare cases fixed.
- berserk strength now lasts the whole level.


Fixes shared with 1.28A
-----------------------

+ Windows 95 support.
+ fix the crouching bug.

- look for patch lumps first in between P_START/P_END.
- handle ALT+TAB better under Windows.
- handle non-power-of-two textures in GL mode.
- allow brain-shooter without any shoot spots (Darren Salt).
- allow compiling without DEVELOPERS define (Darren Salt).
- fix for some memory trashing problems (Darren Salt).


Features removed:
-----------------

+ software rendering has been removed.  We don't have the time to
  maintain the software renderer anymore, and keeping two renderers
  means that adding new features (like slopes and models) needs
  twice as much work (at least -- doing things with OpenGL is
  usually a lot easier than doing it in software).

- using { } comments in DDF files, and ';' comments in RTS scripts
  is now deprecated, since these characters will probably be needed
  in the future when improving DDF/RTS.  Use // comments instead.


General improvements
--------------------

+ drag and drop support.  You no longer have to use the -file option
  to specify filenames (wad files etc).  Everything before the first
  option is considered a filename to add.  This allows you to drag a
  simple (self-contained) WAD onto the EDGE executable to play it.

(FINISHED?)  new sound system, using OpenAL (a 3D audio library). 

(NOT FINISHED) support for OGG Vorbis Music playing.  @@@

+ native support for DeHackEd and BEX patches.  @@@

(NOT FINISHED) new startup.  @@@ - the windows console window.

(NEEDS 2.10) support V3 of GL-NODES.  glbsp 2.10, Deus Vult MAP05, BLAH

- source code uses more C++ features, and more of the EPI (Edge Platform
  Interace).  The "Zone" memory manager has mostly been replaced.

- Linux: fatal errors produce a pop-up dialog box.  EDGE can now be
  run by double clicking the executable.

- Linux: support for CD music.

- sky looks a bit better, with a stretch option in Video menu.
- the old "sky flooding" trick is now emulated.
- RTS tips are sent to the console.
- missing wad files (given with -file) now produce an error.
- monster spawning will keep the parent's AMBUSH status.

- WHEN_APPEAR in DDF and RTS now accepts simpler values.  You can use
  a range for the skill (e.g. "3-5"), you can omit the skill and/or
  the netmode part (e.g. "DM" means deathmatch on any skill, and "3"
  means Hurt-Me-Plenty on any netmode).  Finally, you can add the '!'
  character to the beginning to negate it, e.g. "!SP" means never in
  single-player, and "!4:5" means never in skills 4 or 5.


New features:
-------------

+ new RTS menu system:

    SHOW_MENU      title option1 option2 ...
    SHOW_MENU_LDF  title option1 option2 ...
         
    JUMP_ON  MENU  label1 label2 ...

  The RTS menu will pause the game (including all scripts) until the user
  presses a valid number key.  Savegames are also disabled while the RTS
  menu is shown.

- new SEQUENCE command for ANIMS.DDF.  Use it to specify the full
  animation sequence.  Names cannot be used twice.  Example:

    SEQUENCE = TEX1, TEX2, TEX3, TEX5, TEX8;
 
- PICKUP_EFFECT = SWITCH_WEAPON(xxx) , required for #VERSION 1.29 and
  higher.  Berserk fist.  Compatibility maintained. @@@

- ULTRA_LOYAL thing special.  Friendly monsters don't turn into enemies
  when hurt by your weapon fire.

- SIDE_IMMUNE thing special.  Friendly monsters are completely immune
  from your weapon fire.

(MAY BE REMOVED) - NO_AUTO_SWITCH weapon special.

(MAY BE REMOVED) - FIRST_SILENT_TO_MONSTERS and SECOND_SILENT_TO_MONSTERS weapon specials.

- EXPLODE_RADIUS command for things and attacks.  @@@

- EXPLODE_IMMUNE and ALWAYS_LOUD thing specials.  These attributes
  are both set by the BOSSMAN special, but now they can be specified
  individually.

- FORCE_PICKUP thing special.  
- DIE action for things and attacks.


New command-line options:
-------------------------

    -deh     Specify a DeHackEd (or BEX) patch file.  You can have
	         multiple patch files after the -deh option.


Hats off to...
--------------

Special mention to Erik Sandberg's contribution to EDGE. It's worth a
note that he did a shedload of quality work and made a special effort
to make sure we were GPL legal - something we maintain now.  We do
this since because we have recently removed the software renderer,
we removed about 90% of the work he put into EDGE.
