- allow compiling without DEVELOPERS define (Darren Salt).

Features removed:
-----------------

+ software rendering has been removed.  @@@


General improvements
--------------------

+ drag and drop support.  You no longer have to use the -file option
  to specify filenames (wad files etc).  Everything before the first
  option is considered a filename to add.  This allows you to drag a
  simple (self-contained) WAD onto the EDGE executable to play it.

+ new sound system, using OpenAL (a 3D audio library). 

(NOT FINISHED) support for OGG Vorbis Music playing.  @@@

(NOT FINISHED) build in support for DeHackEd and BEX patches.  @@@

(NOT FINISHED) new startup.  @@@ - the windows console window.

(NOT FINISHED) support V3 of GL-NODES.  glbsp 2.10, Deus Vult MAP05, BLAH

- source code uses more C++ features, and more of the EPI (Edge Platform
  Interace).  The "Zone" memory manager has mostly been replaced.

- Linux: fatal errors produce a pop-up dialog box.  EDGE can now be
  run by double clicking the executable.

- Linux: support for CD music.

- sky looks a bit better, with a stretch option in Video menu.
- the old "sky flooding" trick is now emulated.
- RTS tips are sent to the console.
- missing files (given with -file) now produce an error.
- monster spawning will keep the parent's AMBUSH status.


New features:
-------------

+ new RTS menu system:

    SHOW_MENU      title option1 option2 ...
    SHOW_MENU_LDF  title option1 option2 ...
         
    JUMP_ON  MENU  label1 label2 ...

  The RTS menu will pause the game (including all scripts) until the user
  presses a valid number key.  Savegames are also disabled while the RTS
  menu is shown.

- PICKUP_EFFECT = SWITCH_WEAPON(xxx) , required for #VERSION 1.29 and
  higher.  Berserk fist.  Compatibility maintained.

- FORCE_PICKUP thing special.  
- SIDE_IMMUNE thing special.  @@@
- ULTRA_LOYAL thing special.  @@@
- NO_AUTO_SWITCH weapon special.
- FIRST_SILENT_TO_MONSTERS and SECOND_SILENT_TO_MONSTERS.  @@@
- DIE action for things.ddf.

- EXPLODE_RADIUS command for things and attacks.  @@@

- EXPLODE_IMMUNE and ALWAYS_LOUD (BOSSMAN) @@@


New command-line options:
-------------------------

(NOT FINISHED)  -deh             Specify a DeHackEd (or BEX) patch file.


Hats off to...
--------------

Special mention to Erik Sandberg's contribution to EDGE. It's worth a
note that he did a shedload of quality work and made a special effort
to make sure we were GPL legal - something we maintain now.  We do
this since because we have recently removed the software renderer, we
removed about 90% of the work he put into EDGE.
