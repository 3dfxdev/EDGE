CHANGELOG for EDGE 2.0.4 (since 2.0.3)
====================================

(DATE: 4/24/2016)

+ Two builds included with the package:
  + 3DGE.exe, for older processors that cannot take advantage of instruction sets. Uses older statically-linked libs and older GL headers. Safe for
    older hardware, and integrated Intel/etc GPUs. 

  + 3DGE-SSE2.exe, recommended for newer AMD or Intels. Renders models, OpenGL instructions, and processes images much quicker, using SIMD instructions for
    stuff. Eventually, the SSE build will superscede the older NOSSE binary. For now, we are happy to provide our userbase with both flavors ;)

+ Interpolation is 99% complete, additionally extending to RTS sector functions as well. HUD is interpolated.
  Weapons and all of DDF are interpolated. Step ups (even on slopes) are interpolated: nearly everything _but_ texture scrolling and a few very minor things.

+ r_vsync can now be "0", "1", or "2", depending on hardware configuration. Check this value in the console by typing in r_vsync before changing this. 

+ Additional Bugs Fixed with original maps, logic, etc. Minor but annoying things.

+ Updated Heretic support, adds menu graphics and improved other things. To make it run with the SSE2 build, edit HERETIC.bat and rename the executable.

+ Updated libs for Windows versions. NOSSE uses older libraries, while SSE replaces some entirely. Adopted libjpeg-turbo, and MD5 sse2 calculations,
  and integrated NOASM into some stuff, while upgrading to the brand-new GLEW 2.0.0 (replaced the ancient 1.5). Still planning on abandoning GLEW entirely
  with 2.1.0 and SDL2. 

- We had a Multiplayer menu working along with split and LAN play, but decided to hold off integrating it until 2.1.0 as there are still quite a few small
  issues with connecting to a HOST, as well as input problems with split-screen. Our SDL2 branch has eleviated all control problems, FYI :-)
