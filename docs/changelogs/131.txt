CHANGELOG FOR 1.31-ALPHA (since 1.29)
=====================================

Bugs fixed
----------

+ glitches/small gaps between polygons are fixed.
+ crash with Scuba Steve's flamethrow DEH patch.

- ID(K)FA cheats now give clip weapons full ammo.
- fixed problem saving the 'mipmapping' setting.
- custom sky-boxes should always be used when present.
- fix for filenames (like "foo.bar.wad") containing two dots.
- proper test for existing titlepics in GAMES.DDF.
- fixed console PLAYSOUND cmd when sound is not found.
- fixed badly synchronised flash state of super-shotgun.


Features removed
----------------


General improvements
--------------------

+ new method to emulate DOOM's lighting model.

+ new dynamic lighting,
  DLIGHT2
  LEAKY
  RADIUS not INTENSITY
  MODULATE and ADD (instead of QUADRATIC and LINEAR)

+ improved sky emulation, replacing all the 'SKY STRETCH' options
  with a single mode based on the old MIRROR mode, but tweaked for
  better compatibility with existing DOOM skies.  The old ORIGINAL
  mode now kicks in automatically when MLOOK is disabled.

- better gamma handling (now done by the video driver).
- more robust emulation of the flat-flooding trick.
- console key is configurable.


New features:
-------------

+ MD2 models

+ mirrors

- sector glows

- TGA images

- flat align/scale linetypes


DDF / RTS Goodies:
------------------

+ WEAKNESS

    WEAKNESS.CLASS=B;
	WEAKNESS.HEIGHTS=75%:100%;
	WEAKNESS.ANGLES=135:225;
	WEAKNESS.MULTIPLY=3.0;
	WEAKNESS.PAINCHANCE=100%;

+ BECOME action for THINGS.DDF allows a thing to turn into another
  type of thing.  Can be used on players too.  Health and Side
  values remain the same.  The new state frame can also be given
  (the default is IDLE:1).  Note that becoming something larger
  (bigger RADIUS) can cause the thing to get stuck in walls or
  other objects.  Examples:

    BECOME(THE_CYBERDEMON)
    BECOME(IMP,PAIN:2)

+ armour association, yada yada

- PURPLE armour was added, bringing the number of armours to 5.
  The default protection is 66%, and the layering order (from
  innermost to outermost) is: BLUE, GREEN, PURPLE, YELLOW, RED.

- SPAWN action is similar to DROPITEM action, but it doesn't
  force the object to be non-SOLID like DROPITEM does, plus the
  spawned object will have the same Angle and Side as the parent
  object.  The name must be given in brackets, e.g. SPAWN(IMP).

- INVULNERABLE special makes the thing completely immune to
  all attacks.  There are also two new actions to dynamically
  change it: SET_INVULNERABLE and CLEAR_INVULNERABLE, which
  can be used to make monsters with blocking states (like the
  Centaurs in Hexen).

- DLIGHT_COLOUR(#FF00FF) action will change the color of the
  dynamic light.  Note: the secondary dlight, if used, is not
  affected.

- LIT##

- RESISTANCE_MULTIPLY + RESISTANCE_PAINCHANCE

- VAMPIRE attack special and thing special (for monsters and
  players) which causes the inflictor of damage to gain the
  same amount of health as the damage done to the target.

- new player states: JUMP, FLY, SWIM, CLIMB.
  CHECK_ACTIVITY

- CRUSH_DAMAGE for crushers in lines.ddf

- Weapons.ddf: SHARED_CLIP=TRUE  @@@

- Weapons.ddf: allow 'SEC_ATTACK' to mean 'SECOND_ATTACK' for
  consistency with all the other SEC_XXX commands.

- RTS: 'WHEN=xxx' tag for SPAWNTHING
