CHANGELOG for EDGE 2.0.3 (since 2.0.2)
====================================

(DATE: 4/2/2016)

+ Bugs Fixed (too many to go over in this file)

+ Reworked menu:
  + Split Video Options into two: Screen Options and Video Options.
  + Added new, smaller menu font with much better colors.
  + Re-Centered most text, including multiplayer stuff.
  + Added more menu options from cvars as requested.
  + Added translucent color alphas for menu background drawers for easier readability.

+ HUD text is now drawn to the center of the screen.

+ Win9X support is back, removed SSE2 compiler optimizations so engine can run on more builds

+ Interpolation is slightly improved from the last release, but still needs smooth stepping up.

+ Added OpenGL2 mode (though, sprites are not yet ran through this, so it is set to 1 for now)

- Removed pause on screenwipe (didn't look pretty spawning on the floor, waiting for alternative)
- Removed finale screen "bugfix" (got stuck forever on screens, now instead of black screen, it will just loop over again (this applies to DOOM 1 episodes)
- Removed invulnerability option completely
