*****************************************************
3DGE 1.36E
*****************************************************
(October 2013)

* Author note:
  I apologize for releasing so many versions of 1.36,
  the promised "huge" update for 1.37 is still in
  development and my recent newborn baby has eaten a lot
  of my time and I haven't been able to give 1.37 proper
  attention. This is why I'm releasing this now, so at least
  you all can get an idea on how 3DGE supports HERETIC.
  
  Special thanks to 3DGE contributor Chris "Ceejay" Mullen
  for writing the majority of the DDF code.
                                             -3DGE Team

***
Release Notes (PLEASE READ BEFORE RUNNING HERETIC):
***

++ Added HERETIC support, though it's still WIP. You can
   finish the game from start to end, but the inventory
   support is not implemented. To start:
  
  1) Unzip 1.36E into your Heretic directory. 
  2) Create a shortcut to 1.36E.exe
  3) add the following: -file herfix.wad*
  
  * The Herfix.wad contains important state fixing for
    some of the weapons and creatures. These changes will
    eventually be integrated into edge2.wad.
	
  *!* If you unzip 1.36E into the same folder as DOOM.wad,
	  you *MUST* specify which IWAD you want to use first.
	  Use the -iwad parameter. Otherwise, 3DGE will try and
	  load ALL of the data from HERETIC and DOOM together,
	  which would probably lead to many problems. If you unzip
	  this into a clean directory with only Heretic.wad, you
	  do not need to use the IWAD parameter as 3DGE will
	  pick this up automatically. As per usual, you must have
	  a valid HERETIC IWAD.
	  
	   ++ IMPORTANT: you must rename the "doom_ddf" folder to
	                 her_ddf and specify this in the shortcut
			when running HERETIC, ONLY IF YOU PLAN on
			 keeping both DOOM.wad and HERETIC.wad in
			the same directory. Use the -ddf switch
			for this.
  
  + Two-player support also works here, though the
    input handling has NOT changed, but will be redone
	for 1.37.

  - HERETIC-specific CHEATS have not been implemented, so
    if you plan on using them, you must use the DOOM cheat
	strings. This will eventually be fixed. For instance, you
	cannot warp into a pig (chicken?) yet.
	
  - The HERETIC HUD is not implemented yet, so you will see
    lots of garbage data. I will be releasing a patch to
	Herfix.wad to address this in the following weeks.
	
  - The menus are garbled, so you must navigate carefully. Load
    up normal 3DGE+Doom to memorize the menu layout.
	
+ Took first steps in integrating the MAIN loop from the 
  Dreamcast version, though you cannot run this version on
  the SEGA Dreamcast yet (use Dream3DGE 1.29 for that).
  

*****************************************************
3DGE 1.36D
*****************************************************
(February 2013)

Author Note:
   This version will be the second-to-last before 1.36
   final comes (with all promised fixes). I would like
   to kindly ask that all current users of EDGE 1.35
   to please upgrade to 1.36D - all major problems
   have been taken care of except for the experimental
   stuff defined below. This is so I can focus on all
   future releases of EDGE rather than having diverted
   attention to other versions. Thank you for your
   continued support. Shout out to Andrew Apted for
   generously supporting the authors of 3DGE and the
   entire EDGE community - show all of us that this 
   port can still compete with the big boys and that 
   our work isn't going unnoticed!        -3DGE TEAM

Release Notes:
****

++  MAINTANENCE RELEASE. There are important bugfixes that
    have been addressed! Previous fixes have been
    retained from 1.36C EXCEPT as defined below:

+  HUD Memory Corruption has been resolved, and now
   text correctly writes to the screen again. This was an
   issue with old post-processing code that I have since
   removed. All HUD errors have been fixed, except a
   notable bug in splitscreen with the FACE images -
   a simple fix is to keep the default HUD in splitmode
   rather than choosing to see the full DOOM-style HUD.

+  Customizable styles.ddf (namely, background.image) 
   has been added back and fixed (console image now
   sizes correctly). By default, the menu graphic
   is "CONSOL_P", but you can change this to represent
   a cyan image for full translucency or whatever
   you desire, really. STYLES support is working again
   and was actually restored from 1.36A instead of
   the butchered copy in 1.36C.
 
+  Compatibility between mods made before and after
   1.35 should work fine now. I have chosen not to
   update the savegame patch level so everything
   should work as it did previously. Savegames should
   also continue to work from before.
   
*    DDF "FALLING_SFX" has been renamed to
     "FALLING_SOUND" - this can be used in THINGS.DDF
	 for the player - alternatively, it can also be
	 used for monsters. This will occur if the actor
	 is falling off of something (after -35 units).
   
-  ZOOM bug is back, splitscreen bugs still exist
   for now, and to start Splitscreen you still need
   to define the switch before you start the port.
   These will be fixed with 1.36 final.

*****************************************************
3DGE 1.36C -TEST2-
*****************************************************
(November 2011)

Release Notes:

+ Bugfixes/Improvements for the following:
    
  * 3DGE has limited STYLES support now - the only
     user-configurable DDF is the CONSOLE background
	 image, which is default to the 3DGE logo. This
	 image resides in EDGE2.WAD. The menu graphic
	 is no longer supported.
	
  * Statically-linked EXE no longer needs output
     MinGW DLLS, period. You still need SDL.DLL in
	 the base directory.
  
  * EXE filesize has been greatly reduced.
  
  * NEW FEATURE - SPLITSCREEN MULTIPLAYER -
    * Now, you can begin splitscreen mode simply by
      clicking on the additional BATCH file called
	  "splitscreen". It will ask if you want to play
	  COOP or DM, and what level/difficulty you would
	  like to start on. This is being integrated into
	  the menu and will be available with the final
	  release. You can still create a shortcut by
	  using the -splitscreen parameter and select
	  episode and difficulty. Cheats are disabled by
	  default.
	  
	* Player 2's keys are forced to a joystick for
	  now. The standard config is explained in the
	  additional file, "joy_split.txt". The keys are
	  still not bindable, which will be fixed in the
	  next release. [this feature will actually
	  be available in 1.36D]
	  
	* Second splitscreen now correctly shows palette
	  flashes when picking up items and getting hurt
	  by other enemies. [this feature will actually
	  be available in 1.36D]
	  
	- The HUD is still a WIP and might not give correct
	  counts or update fast enough. HUD message still
	  do not appear in multiplayer (working on a fix).
	  
	- An oversight in RTS scripting gives a BENEFIT
	  to both players instead of the one receiving, this
	  is a known issue and will be corrected in the
	  next release.
	  
  * DDF "SCREAM_SOUND" has been renamed to
     "FALLING_SFX" - this can be used in THINGS.DDF
	 for the player - alternatively, it can also be
	 used for monsters. Added a switch so the sound
	 doesn't automatically repeat after the first
	 falling sound plays in SOUNDS.DDF.
	
  * Bugfix for the Weapon Selection if the player
     had both modeled weapons and sprite weapons in
	 a certain amount. Before, the weapons simply 
	 wouldn't show up when selected.  (thanks AndrewJ)
	
  * Bugfix with ZOOM feature, has been restored to
     an earlier version (now, no more using a weird
	 number).
	 
  * Cleaned-up the source code. Added FBO and PBO for 
    testing the inevitable post processing. Released source.
	
  * Updated and re-worked documentation - split up
    the README into several smaller pieces.
	
  * Bumped edge2.wad version number to 7 due to the
    inclusion of the new console graphic. Updated DDF
	files to version 1.36. 
	
  - There is no more cross compatibility between 3DGE
	and EDGE if mods were created -AFTER- EDGE 1.35. 
	Likewise, mods created for 3DGE 1.36b and lower
	might not function in 3DGE 1.36C.

******************************************************
hyper3DGE 1.36.3b  -NONPRACTICAL TEST ONLY-
******************************************************
(July 2011)

Release Notes:

+  NEW FEATURE "SPLITSCREEN", for testing ONLY. See below.

+  Bugfixes and optimizations

-  HUD may occasionally glitch, working on new things
   in source.
   
-  New Paramter -splitscreen is heavily buggy, no
   input support for player 2 (only the mouse), makes
   playing impractical. Mostly to test the mode on
   numerous systems with weak configurations, especially
   the GPU side. This is not a viable means of multiplay!


******************************************************
hyper3DGE 1.36.3a  -TEST-
******************************************************
(June 2011)

Release Notes:

+  DDF Additions: Added SCREAM_SOUND for the player
   when they fall long distances, ala Hexen.

+  Customizable styles.ddf (namely, background.image) 
   has been added back and fixed (console image now
   sizes correctly).
   
   - Minor bug with STYLES.DDF - if the background
     image or console images aren't defined first,
	 there will be a translucent console screen and/or
	 a black menu screen, etc. This was an oversight.

+  Bumped edge2.wad version number

+  Released Source.

+  Minor cleanups


***********************************************
Version 1.36.2 - TEST - 
***********************************************
(April 2011)

Release Notes:

-  FULL compatibility with EDGE mods now. 

-  This version is a "clean" copy from the official
   final 1.35 release. As such, some of the minor
   additions from 0.35d are not working.

-  Networking stuff has been added in for debugging. 
   *All viable netcode has been disabled for this test!

-  MD3 Support! Syntax is the same as MD2, with the
   exception - lump/file name should be xMD3 instead
   of xMD2 (where 'x' is the name).
   Limitations: single-mesh support only, working on
   full support.

***********************************************
hyper3DGE 1.35D
***********************************************
(February 2011)
