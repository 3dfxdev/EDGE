CHANGELOG for EDGE 2.0.2 (since 2.0.1)
====================================

(DATE: 8/31/2015)

+ Finale screen bugfix: now, no more black screen when ending a DOOM 1 episode (currently non-skippable to match original game behavior)

+ DDF fixes: Chainsaw attack range was set incorrectly, now matches Punching logic; HOOF/METAL sfx audible again.

+ Further dehacked tweak to ignore duplicate entries in dehacked lump if it exists

+ Added Interpolation option under Video Options (default is ON).

+ Finally fixed the SSG appearing in DOOM 1 bug with IDFA/IDKFA cheat.

+ Toned down the red palette effect for pain to match Radiation Suit logic.

+ When the console is dropped down, the game now pauses.

+ When a screen wipe is called, the game will pause and start only after the screen is cleared.

- Invulnerability method was removed from the Video Options menu. The major slowdown issue that was caused because of backface culling has
  been eliminated when "COMPLEX" was selected. Because of the chance of someone messing with it, Invulnerability has been removed from the menu - 
  it is *always* set to "Textured" now.

- Small tweaks here and there, updated edge2.wad, removed unnecessary warning strings from console, etc etc.
