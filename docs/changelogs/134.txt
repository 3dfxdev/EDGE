Features Removed / Changed
--------------------------

+ new language "COAL" replaces Lua for drawing HUDs.

  Documentation about COAL is a bit sparse right now.
  In the 1.34 release the following coal scripts are present:

     doom_ddf/coal_api.ec  :  defines API to the engine
     doom_ddf/coal_hud.ec  :  implements the DOOM HUD

  Coal HUD-drawing scripts may also be included in pwads in a
  lump called "COALHUDS".

+ RTS files now need to the "RTS" extension (not "SCR"), which
  is more accurate, plus the SCR extension is used by MS Windows
  for Screensaver programs.

+ the standard DDF/RTS files have been moved out of EDGE.WAD,
  instead they are stored in a folder called "doom_ddf".

- savegames from 1.31 and earlier do not work.  They do not even
  appear in the menu, because each savegame now has its own folder
  (as a consequence of the new HUB system).

- the old EDGE title screens / music were retired.


General Improvements
--------------------

+ improved console with command history and TAB-completion.

+ better crosshairs with control over size and color.

+ support for keys on the numeric keypad.  Default is enabled
  but you can disable it typing 'in_keypad 0' in the console.

- improved defaults (e.g. 16-bit sound, WASD movement)
- wobble-free scrolling for the automap
- shorter cheat code for 'killall'
- better HOM detection (debug_hom cvar)

- always generate our own BLOCKMAP, ignore REJECT
- improved mouse and keyboard speed settings
- in option menus, current line is highlighted
- new 'goobers' cvar for a fun effect


New Features
------------

+ HUB support.  Please see the 'demo-Hubs.txt' document which is
  included with the EDGE 1.34 release package for more info.

+ Joystick support.

+ obituary messages when the player is killed.  They are created
  by an entry in LANGUAGES.LDF (e.g. OB_ImpClaw), and that entry is
  referenced in the new DAMAGE.OBITUARY field (in an attack).

  The message can contain the following conversions:

     %o  :  the player's name
     %k  :  the monster or opponent which killed the player

- two "Action" buttons which can be set in the Keyboard Controls
  menu and tested by RTS and COAL scripts, as follows:

     RTS:   ONCONDITION ACTION1

     COAL:  if (player.is_action1()) { ... }

  (Replace '1' with '2' to test the other button)

- RTS: new ONCEILINGHEIGHT command (courtesy Andrew Baker) which
  works just like the ONHEIGHT condition but tests the ceiling
  instead of the floor.

- LINES.DDF: can prevent bots using a certain linetype via the
  new "NOBOT" keyword in the ACTIVATORS command.
