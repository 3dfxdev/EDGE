           https://github.com/3dfxdev/hyper3DGE/commit/61cc95457ca90c219489edd7e0c2fac84187e470

+ Bug Fix: Icon of Sin Finale in DOOM II working again

+ Bug Fix: finales are now skippable in DOOM 1 episodes without the "black screen of death"
           https://github.com/3dfxdev/hyper3DGE/commit/586212ffca37513f4202bd2b48c61571d8511a4a

+ Bug Fix: Light-Amp Goggles/Nightvision graphics now show up properly in COAL_HUD.ec
           http://www.tdgmods.net/smf/viewtopic.php?p=4357#p4357

+ Bug Fix: DOOM 1 episode end maps will skip intermission screen instead of displaying stats screen (Added STATS=NONE;)

+ Bug Fix: "Picked up a armor bonus" text changed to "Picked up an armour bonus" in DDFLANG (doom_ddf).

+ Bug Fix: SDL2 Resolution Handling/Window Management has been fixed
           https://sourceforge.net/p/edge2/bugs/8/

+ Bug Fix: Brightness changes on dual-monitor setups no longer affect both screens
           https://sourceforge.net/p/edge2/bugs/1/

+ Bug Fix: 'Use Key' moved to second control page (the previous way prevented reliable changes to major key assignments)
           http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?p=912205#p912205

+ Bug Fix: Behavior of volume control buttons in previous SDL1 builds is now fixed and works properly with SDL2
           https://sourceforge.net/p/edge2/bugs/9/

+ Bug Fix: OPL3 mode fixes.
           https://github.com/3dfxdev/hyper3DGE/pull/17

+ Bug Fix: Screen mode wipes correctly display in OPTIONS menu. 
           https://sourceforge.net/p/edge2/bugs/7/

+ Bug Fix: Interpolation fixes, and VSYNC is restored in the OPTIONS menu.
 	 - If you use VSYNC, make sure its value is set to '2' or higher in the console, using the r_vsync CVAR.
         - Failing to do so will result in a poor framerate and a host of other issues.

+ Bug Fix: Archivile's attack range was previously Unlimited - added ATTACKRANGE=1024; to mimick Vanilla behavior instead.
           https://sourceforge.net/p/edge2/bugs/15/

+ Bug Fix: Mancubus was invulnerable to Chainsaw damage - changed ATTACKRANGE from 63.9 to 96 (same as punch/Vanilla)
           https://sourceforge.net/p/edge2/bugs/2/

+ New Menu: Multiplayer, with the option to start a split-screen game and some basic configurations for the game.
 - You must END GAME (leave game in OPTIONS menu) to reset the gamestate to one-player (for now...)

+ PAK support is mostly completed, and can be used for mods (must have .PAK extension, directory trees not yet supported)

+ NEW FEATURE: New -modpalette command, used to override PLAYPAL for modders who do not wish to use multiple palettes (the 'EDGE' system)

+ DDF: Added GLOOP_SOUND to Things.DDF (GLOOP_SOUND="DSGLOOP";) and in SOUNDS.DDF - it is played when the player steps on a liquid flat.

+ COMPATIBILITY: You must now specify #VERSION 210 to all DDF files in order to use them with 3DGE -- otherwise, you will be forced to run your
                 mod with a new command-line switch -v135. If mods are made with EDGE 1.29 or lower, use the switch -v129.

+ Revised dynamic lighting, much more natural to their attached objects, and vastly reduced surface areas.

+ Heretic support has been vastly improved, but the full-screen overlay HUD still fails to take into account the different Heretic weapon offsets.
  + Heretic menus have been fixed as well. Numerous other small fixes for compatibility. No longer need 'HERFIX.wad'.
  + Two HUDS are now available - standard Heretic, and 3DGE's 'overlay'. Standard Heretic HUD still needs lifechain and lifegem fixes in coal_hud.ec

+ Heretic can now be started without using the batchfile. Heretic's DDF files are located in its own directory, called 'her_ddf'.

+ Staged Wolf3D and ROTT support with command-line args, and DARKWAR.WAD is recognized, but these are far from complete (don't try to load 'em!)

+ DDF's must now be appended with the following version directive: #VERSION 210, and if you load a mod that is designed for anything lower than   3DGE 1.36, a fatal crash will occur -- there is no reliable way to load very old mods (below EDGE 1.29), so they need to be manually patched!

==================
2.1.0 Test-1
RELEASED 6.13.2016

!! This release is a TEST, therefore, certain important features might not work - we make no gaurantees for this version!

* SDL2 support (input, video, controllers, networking) - this is still being developed!

+ NEW FEATURE: OPL music synth. You can now remove the 8MBGMPAT folder and skip using Timidity altogether. 
	* If OPL is not selected, just set it as the active music device and restart the map. Also can select OPL3 mode for stereo panning.

+ NEW FEATURE: grAb PNG chunk (from ZDoom) is implemented, removing the need to manually offset images in IMAGES.DDF if the end-user
  so desires (only for PNG images).
 
+ NEW PACK-INS: Removing Timidity Patches paved the way for a new 'mods' folder, with some recent 3DGE mods being included, and others
  are explicitly defined in a text file named 'Download_ME.txt'. Just copy the desired mod into root and drag n drop to give it a whirl!
  Credits are all included.
  
* DDF math and engine funcs has been refactored and sped up.

* Better glBSP handling/building (upgrade to Eureka's codebase, also converted to c++)

* Better interpolation handling (no stuttering whatsoever!)

* Much smaller EXE under VS, and the code has been heavily optimized and improved due to Visual Studio's awesome optimizations. Also, many
  minor bugs were fixed.

- Resolution list-building and in-game changing is completely broken. Either use your previous config or modify edge2.cfg to your desired
  res. Can also use the command line. This was a result of our continued cleanup of the codebase for SDL2.

- No SSE2 extensions or anything included, and x86. This is to ensure maximum compatibility.

- Heretic support is pretty WIP at this point, as Plums and Cor are redesigning the menu layouts.

- Multiplayer graphic is the menu now, but is not selectable yet. Next release will have split-screen and two-player controls.


==================
v2.0.4 ~Final~
RELEASED 4/24/2016

+ Two builds included with the package:
  + 3DGE.exe, for older processors that cannot take advantage of instruction sets. Uses older statically-linked libs and older GL headers. Safe for
    older hardware, and integrated Intel/etc GPUs. 

  + 3DGE-SSE2.exe, recommended for newer AMD or Intels. Renders models, OpenGL instructions, and processes images much quicker, using SIMD instructions for
    stuff. Eventually, the SSE build will superscede the older NOSSE binary. For now, we are happy to provide our userbase with both flavors ;)

+ Interpolation is 99% complete, additionally extending to RTS sector functions as well. HUD is interpolated.
  Weapons and all of DDF are interpolated. Step ups (even on slopes) are interpolated: nearly everything _but_ texture scrolling and a few very minor things.

+ r_vsync can now be "0", "1", or "2", depending on hardware configuration. Check this value in the console by typing in r_vsync before changing this. 

+ Additional Bugs Fixed with original maps, logic, etc. Minor but annoying things.

+ Updated Heretic support, adds menu graphics and improved other things. To make it run with the SSE2 build, edit HERETIC.bat and rename the executable.

+ Updated libs for Windows versions. NOSSE uses older libraries, while SSE replaces some entirely. Adopted libjpeg-turbo, and MD5 sse2 calculations,
  and integrated NOASM into some stuff, while upgrading to the brand-new GLEW 2.0.0 (replaced the ancient 1.5). Still planning on abandoning GLEW entirely
  with 2.1.0 and SDL2. 

- We had a Multiplayer menu working along with split and LAN play, but decided to hold off integrating it until 2.1.0 as there are still quite a few small
  issues with connecting to a HOST, as well as input problems with split-screen. Our SDL2 branch has eleviated all control problems, FYI :-)

*****************************************************
v2.0.3 CHANGELOG:
RELEASED 4/2/2016
*****************************************************
+ Bugs Fixed (too many to go over in this file)

+ Reworked menu:
  + Split Video Options into two: Screen Options and Video Options.
  + Added new, smaller menu font with much better colors.
  + Re-Centered most text, including multiplayer stuff.
  + Added more menu options from cvars as requested.
  + Added translucent color alphas for menu background drawers for easier readability.

+ HUD text is now drawn to the center of the screen.

+ Win9X support is back, removed SSE2 compiler optimizations so engine can run on more builds

+ Interpolation is slightly improved from the last release, but still needs smooth stepping up.

+ Added OpenGL2 mode (though, sprites are not yet ran through this, so it is set to 1 for now)

- Removed pause on screenwipe (didn't look pretty spawning on the floor, waiting for alternative)
- Removed finale screen "bugfix" (got stuck forever on screens, now instead of black screen, it will just loop over again (this applies to DOOM 1 episodes)
- Removed invulnerability option completely
- 

*****************************************************
v2.0.2 CHANGELOG:
RELEASED 8/31/2015
*****************************************************
+ Finale screen bugfix: now, no more black screen when ending a DOOM 1 episode (currently non-skippable to match original game behavior)

+ DDF fixes: Chainsaw attack range was set incorrectly, now matches Punching logic; HOOF/METAL sfx audible again.

+ Further dehacked tweak to ignore duplicate entries in dehacked lump if it exists

+ Added Interpolation option under Video Options (default is ON).

+ Finally fixed the SSG appearing in DOOM 1 bug with IDFA/IDKFA cheat.

+ Toned down the red palette effect for pain to match Radiation Suit logic.

+ When the console is dropped down, the game now pauses.

+ When a screen wipe is called, the game will pause and start only after the screen is cleared.

- Invulnerability method was removed from the Video Options menu. The major slowdown issue that was caused because of backface culling has
  been eliminated when "COMPLEX" was selected. Because of the chance of someone messing with it, Invulnerability has been removed from the menu - 
  it is *always* set to "Textured" now.

- Small tweaks here and there, updated edge2.wad, removed unnecessary warning strings from console, etc etc.



*****************************************************
3DGE 2.0.1
*****************************************************
(June 2015)


+ MD2/MD3/MD5/MDL models now display with Masked Blending (all of the time),
  so now both sides of a 3D model can be viewed without the backface being
  culled (front-face culling for mirrors is still active). Expensive, 
  but now two-sided models can be rendered. This will eventually become 
  a flag in DDF (MaskBlend in SPECIAL) to allow per-model control rather 
  than the entire model rendering system, in case there are special models
  that don't require two-sided faces.

+ Bobbing is restored in the source code. No need to tinker with the 
  BOBBING= setting, though restoring Bobbing introduces hindered interpolation
  (if r_lerp set to "1"). 2.0.2 will have interpolated head bob. You can adjust
  the bobbing COMMAND to make it less or more severe, depending on your taste.

+ COAL: Added multiple HUDS for DOOM - now you can choose between the classic HUD,
  no HUD, or the 3DGE HUD (improved with on-screen ammo counts). Just toggle between
  them with the +/- keys.

+ Fixed classic DOOM HUD causing weapon to be vertically "squished".

+ Support for FreeDoom Phase 1 and 2 IWADS (freedoom1.wad and freedoom2.wad) and the Chex IWAD. 

+ DDF: Vastly improved Styles.DDF Support (allows MENU/OPTIONS/etc. customizations): can customize
  RTS_MENU now with an animation or graphic. Able to call Anims.DDF through COAL and RTS, 
  Anims.DDF has been improved.

+ DDF: Smoother weapon state ticrates (0.0f), however this is untested.

+ BOOM: Working on more generalised linetype compatibility issues. For now I am adding the linetypes into LINES.DDF as I go.

+ Fixed a bug with the Quit screen rendering all black instead of transparent.

+ Fixed a bug with SpiderDemon and CyberDemon's Walk sounds (METAL/HOOF) not being audible.

+ Removed Dehacked version checking in DEH_edge - now, any kind of DEH should load.

+ Splashscreen can be enabled with a commandline option (-showsplash); disabled by default.

+ HERETIC: New heads-up display, working on writing the default HUD, but for now Heretic users
 can use the streamlined HUD overlay. Integrated patch graphics for the main menu (temporary 
 until menu_strings get implemented). The HUD is not in herddf, but in HERFIX.WAD.

Prototypes added:

* Custom SWIM states for monsters

* Custom ON_CONDITION states for MOBJS (to control through RTS)

* Stencil Buffer added to 3DGE (drawplane reflections for water/etc)

* Bounding Box Upgrades (simple directional physics using lightweight library)

* Caustics on walls

+ Beginning of Half-Life MDL format support (bones, skeletal)

+ Restored DrawLaser in r_Render.cc for eventual laser rendering

+ Fixed MD5 scale and rotation, working on skin_img support

+ Player 2 Input (rework)

+ Start of Decal code (using the Stencil Buffer). 

REMOVED:
+ Action keys 3 + 4 (debugging)

*****************************************************
3DGE 2.0.0 (Alpha1)
*****************************************************
(March 2015)

+ Feature: Rendering Interpolation. You can control this with the following CVARS in the console:
  r_lerp (disables/enables), r_maxfps, r_vsync (helps screen tearing)

+ Feature: MD5 model support (please see the 3DGE wiki for information on how to set this up)  
  -this is still sort of incomplete, as there is no MD5 support for weapons (yet)
  -the MD5 loader cannot process skin_img yet, but the engine will warn you about the skins
  +MD2 and MD3 models are still supported as of this release!

+ Bugfixes: Hardcoded fog removed, vSYNC works, splashscreen restored

+ All changes/fixes from 2.0.1 incorporated

+ DDF: Added SECRET_SOUND entry for OUR_HERO in Things.DDF, and a lump in edge2.wad called DSSECRET.

- The next version will include regulations that prevent older mods not designed for EDGE 1.35+
  to fail, but with instructions on how to convert them to work with the 2.0 branch.

*****************************************************
3DGE 1.4A [Prototype Release]
*****************************************************
(September 2014)

This release is a stopgap to show new features and is the last in the 1.x codebase:

In the first step towards 3DGE 2.0, this release incorporates: 
+ rendering interpolation, though really unfinished (disable with r_lerp)
 - Currently, doors/lifts/misc remain hard-capped at 35hz
 -Interpolation throws as many frames up as possible, resulting in inconsistent framerate and no VSYNC
- Hardcoded fog (cannot disable)
- Splash screen is disabled
+ Almost all EDGE 1.32 code is removed
- Headbob is disabled in this release
+ Incorporated Splines lib
+ MD5 backend code lib
+ Quaternion support in EPI: /epi (math_quaternions), used for interpolation, MD5, and Splines


*****************************************************
3DGE 1.36F
*****************************************************
(July 2014)

As per suggestion, this version executable is just named "3DGE.exe". 

+ Feature: Two NEW Action Buttons (ACTION3 and ACTION4).

+ Bugfix: Dehacked Strings now never run out of lines

+ Cosmetic: Options Drawer cleaned up, removed splitscreen controls menu (for now)

+ Cosmetic: disk-loading icon is now disabled by default (re-enable with m_diskicon)

+ Cosmetic: Game now lets player know in console and HUD when a game has been saved.

+ Cosmetic: New Default HUD replaces the old BOOM-style one from DosDoom 0.653

+ Heretic: To Run Heretic, run HERETIC.BAT. This will append herfix.wad, HDF, and
           the Heretic IWAD.

*****************************************************
3DGE 1.36E
*****************************************************
(October 2013)

* Author note:
  I apologize for releasing so many versions of 1.36,
  the promised "huge" update for 1.37 is still in
  development and my recent newborn baby has eaten a lot
  of my time and I haven't been able to give 1.37 proper
  attention. This is why I'm releasing this now, so at least
  you all can get an idea on how 3DGE supports HERETIC.
  
  Special thanks to 3DGE contributor Chris "Ceejay" Mullen
  for writing the majority of the DDF code.
                                             -3DGE Team

***
Release Notes (PLEASE READ BEFORE RUNNING HERETIC):
***

++ Added HERETIC support, though it's still WIP. You can
   finish the game from start to end, but the inventory
   support is not implemented. To start:
  
  1) Unzip 1.36E into your Heretic directory. 
  2) Create a shortcut to 1.36E.exe
  3) add the following: -file herfix.wad*
  
  * The Herfix.wad contains important state fixing for
    some of the weapons and creatures. These changes will
    eventually be integrated into edge2.wad.
	
  *!* If you unzip 1.36E into the same folder as DOOM.wad,
	  you *MUST* specify which IWAD you want to use first.
	  Use the -iwad parameter. Otherwise, 3DGE will try and
	  load ALL of the data from HERETIC and DOOM together,
	  which would probably lead to many problems. If you unzip
	  this into a clean directory with only Heretic.wad, you
	  do not need to use the IWAD parameter as 3DGE will
	  pick this up automatically. As per usual, you must have
	  a valid HERETIC IWAD.
	  
	   ++ IMPORTANT: you must rename the "doom_ddf" folder to
	                 her_ddf and specify this in the shortcut
			when running HERETIC, ONLY IF YOU PLAN on
			 keeping both DOOM.wad and HERETIC.wad in
			the same directory. Use the -ddf switch
			for this.
  
  + Two-player support also works here, though the
    input handling has NOT changed, but will be redone
	for 1.37.

  - HERETIC-specific CHEATS have not been implemented, so
    if you plan on using them, you must use the DOOM cheat
	strings. This will eventually be fixed. For instance, you
	cannot warp into a pig (chicken?) yet.
	
  - The HERETIC HUD is not implemented yet, so you will see
    lots of garbage data. I will be releasing a patch to
	Herfix.wad to address this in the following weeks.
	
  - The menus are garbled, so you must navigate carefully. Load
    up normal 3DGE+Doom to memorize the menu layout.
	
+ Took first steps in integrating the MAIN loop from the 
  Dreamcast version, though you cannot run this version on
  the SEGA Dreamcast yet (use Dream3DGE 1.29 for that).
  

*****************************************************
3DGE 1.36D
*****************************************************
(February 2013)

Author Note:
   This version will be the second-to-last before 1.36
   final comes (with all promised fixes). I would like
   to kindly ask that all current users of EDGE 1.35
   to please upgrade to 1.36D - all major problems
   have been taken care of except for the experimental
   stuff defined below. This is so I can focus on all
   future releases of EDGE rather than having diverted
   attention to other versions. Thank you for your
   continued support. Shout out to Andrew Apted for
   generously supporting the authors of 3DGE and the
   entire EDGE community - show all of us that this 
   port can still compete with the big boys and that 
   our work isn't going unnoticed!        -3DGE TEAM

****
Release Notes:
****

++  MAINTANENCE RELEASE. There are important bugfixes that
    have been addressed! Previous fixes have been
    retained from 1.36C EXCEPT as defined below:

+  HUD Memory Corruption has been resolved, and now
   text correctly writes to the screen again. This was an
   issue with old post-processing code that I have since
   removed. All HUD errors have been fixed, except a
   notable bug in splitscreen with the FACE images -
   a simple fix is to keep the default HUD in splitmode
   rather than choosing to see the full DOOM-style HUD.

+  Customizable styles.ddf (namely, background.image) 
   has been added back and fixed (console image now
   sizes correctly). By default, the menu graphic
   is "CONSOL_P", but you can change this to represent
   a cyan image for full translucency or whatever
   you desire, really. STYLES support is working again
   and was actually restored from 1.36A instead of
   the butchered copy in 1.36C.
 
+  Compatibility between mods made before and after
   1.35 should work fine now. I have chosen not to
   update the savegame patch level so everything
   should work as it did previously. Savegames should
   also continue to work from before.
   
*    DDF "FALLING_SFX" has been renamed to
     "FALLING_SOUND" - this can be used in THINGS.DDF
	 for the player - alternatively, it can also be
	 used for monsters. This will occur if the actor
	 is falling off of something (after -35 units).
   
-  ZOOM bug is back, splitscreen bugs still exist
   for now, and to start Splitscreen you still need
   to define the switch before you start the port.
   These will be fixed with 1.36 final.

*****************************************************
3DGE 1.36C -TEST2-
*****************************************************
(November 2011)

Release Notes:

+ Bugfixes/Improvements for the following:
    
  * 3DGE has limited STYLES support now - the only
     user-configurable DDF is the CONSOLE background
	 image, which is default to the 3DGE logo. This
	 image resides in EDGE2.WAD. The menu graphic
	 is no longer supported.
	
  * Statically-linked EXE no longer needs output
     MinGW DLLS, period. You still need SDL.DLL in
	 the base directory.
  
  * EXE filesize has been greatly reduced.
  
  * NEW FEATURE - SPLITSCREEN MULTIPLAYER -
    * Now, you can begin splitscreen mode simply by
      clicking on the additional BATCH file called
	  "splitscreen". It will ask if you want to play
	  COOP or DM, and what level/difficulty you would
	  like to start on. This is being integrated into
	  the menu and will be available with the final
	  release. You can still create a shortcut by
	  using the -splitscreen parameter and select
	  episode and difficulty. Cheats are disabled by
	  default.
	  
	* Player 2's keys are forced to a joystick for
	  now. The standard config is explained in the
	  additional file, "joy_split.txt". The keys are
	  still not bindable, which will be fixed in the
	  next release. [this feature will actually
	  be available in 1.36D]
	  
	* Second splitscreen now correctly shows palette
	  flashes when picking up items and getting hurt
	  by other enemies. [this feature will actually
	  be available in 1.36D]
	  
	- The HUD is still a WIP and might not give correct
	  counts or update fast enough. HUD message still
	  do not appear in multiplayer (working on a fix).
	  
	- An oversight in RTS scripting gives a BENEFIT
	  to both players instead of the one receiving, this
	  is a known issue and will be corrected in the
	  next release.
	  
  * DDF "SCREAM_SOUND" has been renamed to
     "FALLING_SFX" - this can be used in THINGS.DDF
	 for the player - alternatively, it can also be
	 used for monsters. Added a switch so the sound
	 doesn't automatically repeat after the first
	 falling sound plays in SOUNDS.DDF.
	
  * Bugfix for the Weapon Selection if the player
     had both modeled weapons and sprite weapons in
	 a certain amount. Before, the weapons simply 
	 wouldn't show up when selected.  (thanks AndrewJ)
	
  * Bugfix with ZOOM feature, has been restored to
     an earlier version (now, no more using a weird
	 number).
	 
  * Cleaned-up the source code. Added FBO and PBO for 
    testing the inevitable post processing. Released source.
	
  * Updated and re-worked documentation - split up
    the README into several smaller pieces.
	
  * Bumped edge2.wad version number to 7 due to the
    inclusion of the new console graphic. Updated DDF
	files to version 1.36. 
	
  - There is no more cross compatibility between 3DGE
	and EDGE if mods were created -AFTER- EDGE 1.35. 
	Likewise, mods created for 3DGE 1.36b and lower
	might not function in 3DGE 1.36C.

******************************************************
hyper3DGE 1.36.3b  -NONPRACTICAL TEST ONLY-
******************************************************
(July 2011)

Release Notes:

+  NEW FEATURE "SPLITSCREEN", for testing ONLY. See below.

+  Bugfixes and optimizations

-  HUD may occasionally glitch, working on new things
   in source.
   
-  New Paramter -splitscreen is heavily buggy, no
   input support for player 2 (only the mouse), makes
   playing impractical. Mostly to test the mode on
   numerous systems with weak configurations, especially
   the GPU side. This is not a viable means of multiplay!


******************************************************
hyper3DGE 1.36.3a  -TEST-
******************************************************
(June 2011)

Release Notes:

+  DDF Additions: Added SCREAM_SOUND for the player
   when they fall long distances, ala Hexen.

+  Customizable styles.ddf (namely, background.image) 
   has been added back and fixed (console image now
   sizes correctly).
   
   - Minor bug with STYLES.DDF - if the background
     image or console images aren't defined first,
	 there will be a translucent console screen and/or
	 a black menu screen, etc. This was an oversight.

+  Bumped edge2.wad version number

+  Released Source.

+  Minor cleanups


***********************************************
Version 1.36.2 - TEST - 
***********************************************
(April 2011)

Release Notes:

-  FULL compatibility with EDGE mods now. 

-  This version is a "clean" copy from the official
   final 1.35 release. As such, some of the minor
   additions from 0.35d are not working.

-  Networking stuff has been added in for debugging. 
   *All viable netcode has been disabled for this test!

-  MD3 Support! Syntax is the same as MD2, with the
   exception - lump/file name should be xMD3 instead
   of xMD2 (where 'x' is the name).
   Limitations: single-mesh support only, working on
   full support.
