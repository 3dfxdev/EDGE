Reworked HUD, Added missing sounds, Added missing menu graphics

February 19, 2013
-----------------

Made fixes to a linetype so it behaves closer to its Heretic counterpart and in the hopes of making E4M1 possible to exit. But there seems to be something really wrong and I doubt it's with the linetype itself.

-----------------
February 19, 2013
-----------------

Heretic scroll sectors (sectors that pushes the player along) added to SECTORS.DDF. I'm not sure of the accuracy and the actual floor itself doesn't scroll.

All enemies should, hopefully, drop their respective items accordingly when killed.

Ammo items, as dropped by enemies, have been implemented and they are dropped randomly by monsters like in Heretic.

-----------------
February 18, 2013
-----------------

Weapon items were given the same treatment as the ammo items

Ammo items are now handled diffrently, partially through the use of RTS scripts. This gives improved control on how much ammo you recieve.

Made some slight adjustments to the wind and waterfall ambience

The small volcanos are added in, they work but are a bit glitchy. Again, a LOWGRAVITY tag or a way of controlling how much gravity a projectile has would be useful, almost required for true Heretic/Hexen support I would say.

-----------------
February 17, 2013
-----------------

NO_STRETCH_SKY and NORMAL_SKY special added to all levels, but it doesn't seem to do anything
*These are deprecated commands - will be fixed shortly.

Correct sky texture for each episode

Gave the three bonus levels their unofficial names

Gargoyles are now spawned on the ceiling. Though in Heretic, they appear to be spawned at a random height.

Speed of line trigger 7, build stairs, increased to match the one(s) from HERETIC

More line triggers were given a stop sound.

The gargoyles death is now more accurate, it's without gravity for the first few frames and THEN falls down.

The gargoyle radius has been corrected, it was too large causing groups of gargoyles to get stuck to eachother.

Got the small HERETIC fonts partially working in-game thanks to FONTS.DDF and STYLES.DDF

NOFRICTION tag removed from enemies, it was causing some perculiar behaviour

Another wind sector: Strong wind north

Speed of the waterfall and lava texture animations increased.

Intensity of dynamic lightning for the blue and red glitter reduced. It was causing noticable lag when there was a lot of it in one spot.

Thing 56 (green wooden torch) replaced with blank object, see E3M8. I believe it is meant to be a teleport marker for D'Sparil.

Correct endscreen added for the conclusion of episode 2, though this image is supposed to use its own unique palette lump (E2PAL)

Line triggers and RTS scripts cleaned and sorted.

Linetrigger 107 replaced with new one, build stairs. Used in E3M8.

D'Sparil triggers correct linetype(s) upon death, making it possible to finish the level

D'Sparil, both forms, added with no attack yet. It is a little glitchy though, but, works.

No intermission/stats screen for boss levels (E1M8, E2M8, etc.)

Medium wind push speed increased and the weak wind inherits the medium winds previous speed. Seems more accurate.

Added NOGRAVITY tag for scenery decorations so they, like items, won't be affected by wind

Another wind sector added: Weak wind east

Endtexts along with background tile added for all five episodes, though the font used is still the one from DOOM

Added a stop sound (FLOOR.SFX_STOP) to a couple of linetriggers.

Episode bosses (Iron Lich in E1M8 and Maulotaur in E2M8) now trigger their respective linetypes when killed so the levels can be played through.

Maulotuar added but, like the Iron Lich, he does not attack yet.

Reduced the ammount of friction for ice sectors, not as crazy anymore

Further improvements made to the Pod generator, most notably PRESTEP_SPAWN replaced with ANGLED_SPAWN for the spawner attack.

"E#M#" added to the beginning of level names in LANGUAGE.DDF, so you can tell which map you're currently playing in the automap.

Moving speed of line trigger 106, build stairs, increased to better match the original. Most notably used in E1M1.

-----------------
February 16, 2013
-----------------

REFIRE_CHECK pointer replaced with FACETARGET for the Ophidians attack.

Disciples/Wizards now actually do flicker in and out of ghost mode while attacking instead of just simply fading in and out of transparency.

Some minor changes made to the Phoneix projectile, it wasn't working properly when dealing with ghost enemies.

NOFRICTION codepointer added for enemies. Friction (ice sectors) appears to only affect players in Heretic

Sectors with friction (ice) added to SECTORS.DDF, but there's too much friction and I can't seem to get it right

Added a credits tag at the beginning of most the DDF files

Some of the ammo items were missing their animation, fixed

Made some adjustements to the Firemace projectiles, still doesn't bounce but the pattern is more accurate

Added the Iron Lich but he doesn't attack yet, functions as a sort of placeholder for the time being

Made improvements to the Pod generator, probably not very accurate but it seems to work alright

-----------------
February 15, 2013
-----------------

The exploding pod was added, doesn't respawn yet though

The Hellstaff, Phoenix Road and Firemace are in! However, charged-up versions of the weapons are yet to be done
and I was not able to make the Firemace projectile(s) behave as they do in Heretic, they don't bounce (we need a LOWGRAVITY tag?)
but speed and damage should be accurate

Reduced the chance for the Undead Warrior to throw his red axe, it was happening too often

Pod generator added. It does not work very well though.
