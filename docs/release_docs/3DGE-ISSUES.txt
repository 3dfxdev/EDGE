3DGE 2.1.0 Test3
======================
KNOWN ISSUES
======================
As mentioned in the Readme, contained is a list of 
all of the known issues in 3DGE. Make sure to check
here before posting in the support forums.

======================

Known Issues:
  - OpenGL 3 mode does not pass sprites through the renderer yet.

  - Shader support is still a work in progress. If you hardware does not
    support it, or you notice slugglishness, restart 3DGE with the command-
    line switch, "-norenderbuffers". This will disable the post-processing
    available in OpenGL2 and up (it will work even if you are set to 'OpenGL1
    mode' - most hardware supports it by default).

  - HERETIC support is heavily in WIP:
	- Cheats do not work
	- Inventory is not possible - pickups behave like DOOM.
	- HUD is not finished/

  - Splitscreen multiplayer is a bit buggy and the control input
    is hacked up - this will be fixed in future releases. As of the latest
    test, Splitscreen is non-functional due to the introduction of shaders.

  - Wolfenstein 3D, while working, does not actually let you do anything
    in-game yet. ROTT support will load the IWAD but will not let you do
    anything (yet).

  - Multiplayer (true networking) does not work.  The type of networking
    that DOOM used back in 1994 is obsolete today, and 3DGE doesn't
    have a suitable replacement yet.

  - Drag-and-drop does not work in Linux.

  - Linux + certain older ATI models will not render the post-processing
    effects correctly - this is a known bug with AMD's Linux drivers.

  - Mods MUST upgrade their version directive in DDF to 2.10.

  - Some sprites are designed to look sunk into the floor, typically
    corpses, and can look like they are "floating" in 3DGE.  This is a
    limitation of using OpenGL rendering (if the sprites are lowered,
    they get clipped and this looks a lot worse).

    Certain other DOOM tricks, e.g. flat-flooding, sometimes don't
    work properly with 3DGE's renderer.

  - CAMERA-MAN SYSTEM:
   - Different types of interpolation (maybe splines as well),
   - Debug view mode (gizmos for camera-man objects),
   - Free camera mode (no inertia in movement, for better editing),
   - Disable HUD when camera-man is in use,
   - Disable camera movement on player's input when camera-man is in use.


=============================
ERRORS, AND HOW TO SOLVE THEM:
=============================

    Q: 3DGE doesn't start! It's crap!!

    >A) Make sure the IWAD you want to load is in the same folder as the executable, or your DOOMWADDIR and DOOMWADPATH
        are defined. Just follow the same way its done with normal DOOM and you will be fine. We are working on an
        automatic IWAD selector, but in the meantime -- keep it oldschool. ;-)
      

    Q:  The procedure entry point ucrtbase.terminate could not be located in the dynamic liabrary api-ms-win-crt-              runtime-l1-1-0.dll. What do I do??

    >A) You need to (re)install the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, either via Windows Update or        download and directly install the Visual C++ Redistributable. See https://sourceforge.net/p/edge2/bugs/28/.
