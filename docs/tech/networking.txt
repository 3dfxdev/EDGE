===============

Topology
--------

Each "client" will be connected to the "host" computer
using a "reliable link", which will be TCP/IP.

There is also the "broadcast link" which each client
normally uses for sending/receiving "ticcmd" packets.

The host always uses the broadcast link if any client does.

When a client doesn't use the broadcast link, the host is
responsible for emulating the broadcast, in two ways:
  (1) ticcmds received from non-BC --> broadcasted to ALL clients
  (2) ticcmds received from BC --> transmitted to non-BC clients

STATE: client: is_using_broadcast_link [true/false]
       (host needs to know this state).

We assume the broadcast link can be unreliable in two ways:
  (1) a sent packet may not reach every client, or even any client
  (2) sent packets may arrive out of order.

When a client thinks it has missed a broadcast packet,
it asks the host for the packet using the reliable link
and receives that packet (possibly some time later) also
over the reliable link.

When the _HOST_ thinks it missed a broadcast packet,
it asks the client directly via the reliable link,
and the client responds over the reliable link.


Formats
-------

Ticcmd packets are binary format and contain one or more
full_ticcmd_t structures.  Each full_ticcmd_t describes
the player input for the specified game tic.

Ticcmd packets begins with:

   "@TIC"  : these four bytes (identifier)
   count   : 1 byte, number of full_ticcmd_t in the packet
   padding : 1 byte, always zero

which is followed by the full_ticcmd_t structures:

   - gametic : 4 bytes

   - rest of the ticcmd_h structure (16 bytes),
     which includes a 'player_idx' field.


Every other type of packet contains a payload using
text format messages.  The text encoding is Unicode UTF-8
and a single LF ('\n') character is used to break lines.
For simplicity the packet is terminated with ^Z (code 26).

The beginning of each text format packet is a single
line with a keyword surrounded by square brackets.
If the packet expects a reply a '?' is also present.
For example:

  [HOST?]

Each line in a text format packet is typically a
series of keywords/values separated by a single space.

String values are delimited by double quotes (""),
and the '\' character can escape a single character.

Integer values may be preceded by '0x' to denote
hexadecimal numbers.


Protocol
--------

For clients to find the host via broadcasting:

   client broadcasts:
      [HOST?]
   
   host broadcasts back:
      [HERE]
      ADDRESS 192.168.0.151
      PORT 26710

For client connecting to host:

   client makes TCP/IP connection

   client sends:
     [HELLO]
     PLAYER "Andrew"
     BROADCAST TRUE

   host replies:
     [WELCOME]

   or
     [ERROR]
     MSG "You ain't welcome here fella!"


Host will send to client before game starts:
(possibly multiple times)

     [PARAMS]
     GAME "HELL ON EARTH"
     LEVEL "MAP01"
     SKILL 3
     MODE OLDDM    (NEWDM  COOP  CTF  LASTMAN)
     RANDOM_SEED 0x12345678
     FLAGS 0x000104c7

     [PLAYERS]
     1 YOU "Matt" CONSOLE
     2 YOU "Mark" BOT
     3 NET "Luke" CONSOLE
     4 NET "John" BOT

     [BEGIN]


Other packets:

     [NOP]

     [GOODBYE]    (client to host when quit)

     [PISSOFF]    (host to client)

     [RETRANS?]   (can be sent both ways)
     GAMETIC 123456
     PLAYER  5
