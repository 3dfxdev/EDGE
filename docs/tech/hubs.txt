Hub System
----------

Basic idea is that every visited hub level, except the current
level, is stored in a savegame with a special name:

    HUB##.esg

To perform a full savegame, the current level is saved normally,
for example to file SAVE0123.esg, and the hub savegames are
simply copied, e.g. HUB02.esg --> SAVE0123_02.esg.

Performing a full loadgame means copying the hub savegames
and then doing a normal load for the current level.

Whenever a new level is started normally (not part of the
current hubs), then all the HUB## savegames must be deleted.
They should also be deleted when the engine shuts down.

The engine must keep a current list of "dormant" hubs, so
it knows when to do a "hub load" instead of a normal level
load.  This dormant hub list must also be saved into full
savegames, but not hub savegames.

When loading from a hub savegame, we must not clobber the
current player information, or the dormant hub information.
