Hub System V2.0
---------------

Hubs are implemented mainly by managing savegame files.

Assume $SAVEDIR is the directory for savegames.

Each full savegame has it's own folder: $SAVEDIR/slot###/
There is also one for the current game: $SAVEDIR/current/

Within one of these folders, there is a savegame for the
current map, called "head.esg", and there can be savegames
for previously visited levels, which are just the map name
with the "esg" extension, for example: "map01.esg".

PERFORM SAVE GAME:
  -  save map into $SAVEDIR/current/head.esg
  -  create or clear the $SAVEDIR/slot### folder
  -  copy contents of $SAVEDIR/current --> $SAVEDIR/slot###

PERFORM LOAD GAME:
  -  clear contents of $SAVEDIR/current
  -  copy contents of $SAVEDIR/slot### --> $SAVEDIR/current
  -  load map from $SAVEDIR/current/head.esg
     (but skip players)

CLEAN UP OPERATION:
  -  clear contents of $SAVEDIR/current
     (do this at engine startup, begin new game, leave game)

LEAVE MAPxx / ENTER MAPyy:
  -  save map into $SAVEDIR/current/mapXX.esg
  -  if $SAVEDIR/current/mapYY.esg exists, load it,
     otherwise load fresh map
  -  connect players to [HUB_START] things in tagged sector
     (ignore normal player starts).
