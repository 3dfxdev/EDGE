Camera-man System readme

 1. What is Camera-man
	Camera-man system governs setup and handling of configurable camras that can be triggered via scripts and console commands. User can setup positions and view angels of camera and store
	them with a set	of commands given below. The setup is stored per level basis, i.e. each game lavel has it's own 'camdata' file.
	
 2. Basics
	2.1 Console Commands
		Basic setup of the camera-man system is done via set of console commands, listed below:
		 - 'actcam' - activates (turns on) the system, by default it is inactive; the command requires a single parameter to indicated whether to turn on or off the system (1 or 0),
		 - 'rstcam' - resets the system to its default state (erases all stored cameras and turns it off),
		 - 'addcam' - adds a new camera in player's current location and orientation; it requires two parameters - field-of-view angle, in degrees and a name for the camera (which is optional),
		 - 'remcam' - removes a camera of given idetifier (provided by 'addcam') or name; removal by name requires the first parameter to be set to -1,
		 - 'swtcam' - switches the view to the camera given by an identifier or a name; switching by name requires the first parameter to be set to -1,
		 - 'strcam' - sets the camera of given identifier or name as the first one (start) to interpolate between; setting the camera by name requires the first parameter to be set to -1,
		 - 'endcam' - sets the camera of given identifier or name as the second one (end) to interpolate between; setting the camera by name requires the first parameter to be set to -1,
		 - 'poscam' - sets position of the camera of given identifier or name to be players current position; setting the camera by name requires the first parameter to be set to -1,
		 - 'angcam' - sets angles of the camera of given identifier or name to be players current angles (vertical and horizontal); setting the camera by name requires 
					  the first parameter to be set to -1,
		 - 'fovcam' - sets field-of-view angle (in degrees) of the camera of given identifier or name to be of the given value; setting the camera by name requires the first parameter to be set to -1,
		 - 'savcam' - saves current state of the system to a file located in a sub-directory specified in 'camera_subdir' global variable (by default set to 'doom_ddf/cameras'); 
					  saved file name is the same as the name of the currently open map,
		 - 'lddcam' - loads the state of the system from a file located in a sub-directory specified in 'camera_subdir' global variable (by default set to 'doom_ddf/cameras');
					  loaded file name is the same as the name of the currently open map,
		 - 'prtcam' - prints debugging information about current state of the system (i.e. lists all cameras avaiable),
		 - 'tghelp' - toggles rendering of helper gizmos in the engine (e.g. gizmos showing where cameras were set up).
		 
	2.2 COAL Interface
		Camera-man system is also controlable via COAL scripts, through the following procedures (some functions from command console are not used though):
		 - 'cameraman.activate(1|0)' - same as 'actcam',
		 - 'cameraman.is_active()' - return indication whether the systm is active,
		 - 'cameraman.set_start_id(id [, name])' - same as 'strcam',
		 - 'cameraman.set_end_id(id [, name])' - same as 'endcam',
		 - 'cameraman.get_start_id()' - returns the identifier of the start camera (set with 'set_start_id'),
		 - 'cameraman.get_end_id()' - returns the identifier of the end camera (set with 'set_end_id'),
		 - 'cameraman.set_step(time_step)' - sets the interpolation value with which the interpolated position and view angles are taken from start and end cameras (interpolation is linear),
		 - 'cameraman.switch_to(id [, name])' - same as 'swtcam',
		 - 'cameraman.load()' - same as 'lddcam'.
		 
	2.3 RTS Interface
		Camera-man system is also controlable via RTS scripts, though the set of calls is very basic:
		 - 'LOAD_CAMERAS map_name' - activates the system and loads 'camdata' for current level,
		 - 'ACTIVATE_CAMERA cam_id|cam_name' - switches view to the camera given by the identifier or name provided.
