DDFALL General Description
=====

I think the idea behind DDFALL was being able to put any
type of DDF definitions into a single lump, which could be
more convenient than having to create several lumps.

I don't remember what happened to the idea, it probably
turned out to be more difficult than we thought and so we
decided to not bother about it.

For example, I remember that the current DDF code (well the
stuff in 1.35) needs to read files or lumps in a certain order,
such as all the attacks before all the things, but a system like
DDFALL would require being able to read stuff in any order,
which may require some major surgery to the DDF code.
