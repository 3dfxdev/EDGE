LOG 6/5/2011: 
added scream_Sound for falling screams from Hexen source

6/6/2011:
Got basic Fog working in 3DGE (with screenshot)

Did some more stuff with s_roqplay.cc in /src. Looks like I'll have to bind
SDL some other way. 

Also, GLFog works but nothing else will, so I have to take this command
and make it sector-based. It's not true fog, but it works just fine. ;)

6/7/2011:
Got scream sound finalized with screamwait in source (with Ajapted's guidance).

Started basic shadow support in source.
