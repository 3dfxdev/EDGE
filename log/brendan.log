/* Ideas to deal with mousewheel speed problem:

-Put in a sensitivity control for it similar to the mouse sensitivity (treat it as a third mouse axis)
	Pros:
		-Can use mousewheel for other cool things, like height control while flying
		-Code already exists for it, just needs to be adapted
	Cons:
		-Lose the ability to easily use it as buttons. Assigning it in the menu just got weird.
		-Menu overhaul just got more complicated.
		-Need to write code code for deciding what (third axis delta? distance scrolled?) equals how many button presses

-Put in a trigger cooldown so events can only be triggered so often (once every 100ms sounds sane, or even once per tic or two)
	Pros:
		-Sounds easy to implement
		-Works with existing menu system
	Cons:
		-No third axis. Games stuck with current usefulness.
		-Might complicate things for touch users. (or maybe not. Needs to be tested...)

-Only allow the first few triggers to queue, dump the rest
	Pros:
		-So easy a drunk monkey with one arm could code it.
			For (bad) example:
			if (lastevent == scrollup and (event.timestamp - lastevent.timestamp) < 500ms or so ) { 
				if (i < 6ish) {
					i++; return event
				} else {
					return nothing }
			} else {
				i=0; return event }
	Cons:
		-Sloppy. Would feel like a drunk monkey with one arm was using it.
		
-Remove mousewheel support entirely. I mean, who Really uses that?
	Pros:
		-Takes literally a minute to do properly. If I'm a lazy asshole, already complete.
		-???
	Cons:
		-Wait, *I* might use that! Maybe. Ok, so I only noticed it was missing because I was debugging it.
		-What are you, a communist?
		-Makes Batman cry.
