------------------
5.8.2016:
Added a new cvar, r_spriteflipped, that will flip all [A0] sprites horizontally,
as a consumer feature (i.e., not DDF). 

Eventually, I will DDF-itize this, 
for modders who can find it useful: STATES(DEATH)=TROO:A:1:NORMAL:FLIPPED, 
(flipped could be the marker that passes the *flip bool in R2_GetThingSprite2).

Okay, just DDF-itized this as a hyperflag, HF_MIRRORED, in ddf/things.cc. That way,
it can affect the entire sprite (which means that randomizers are now possible for this
behavior in DDF). I should probably squash this down some more...

Again, okay, in DDF, just added the MAKEMIRRORED thing_special in actioncode_t, that
will make the object mirrored! Gotta actually write P_ActMakeMirrored now. . .

------------------------------------

5.7.2016:
More work on PAK today, defined raw pak headers and structures into dm_structs.h
Added basic detection to w_wad.cc (FLKIND_PAK), routed from <- e_main.cc

The thing here is to add PAK file/directory support into the engine, and once it
is finalized, edge2.wad will become edge.pak. That way, people cannot
muck about with the official wadfile anymore. PAKs also offers better
compression and readtimes over WAD, especially for low-mem systems, mainly
Dreamcast read/write/cache/flush, etc. 

^^(Will also solve the 8-character lumpname limit currently existing with WAD. 
Users always had to hack this by, for instance, declaring the 8 char limit in 
IMAGES.ddf, but we worked around that by having the  "entry name", defined 
in the first [brackets], to be however long neccesary, and used that as a lookup.)

Added basic pk3 detection in e_main, will warn the user if it detects a PK3 being
loaded. Will most likely start on pk3 after PAK is declared finished, and then the
WAD2/WAD3 formats (remember those Andrew??)

I_ShowCPU simplified for logfile, complex for debugfile. Anyways, people send their
debugs over their standard logs, which begs the question - should I do away with the
standard LOG? Maybe make DEBUG.txt -> debug.edge, and be done with two kinds... something
to think about... The only thing EDGE2.LOG offers over debug.txt is simplicity and less crap
mucking about if I am searching for something quick...yeeaahh...take a vote maybe?

More SDL2 improvements: SDL_StartTextInput() solved the "no shift+char" in console!

Implemented "Multiplayer" menu selection into our main menu drawer, but selecting it does nothing (yet),
this was a change over how Legacy does it (implemented it into Single Player) - this way mirrors the
way Quake does it(â„¢)

Started a new "Working Directory" for 3DGE in SourceTree (which is what I use to manage Github/etc).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TODO:
More Heretic detection stuff (adding skulls around logo in menu, setting global bool for heretic_mode)

Rip out (completely this time...) HawkNL. Suitable and doable replacements for 3DGE NETWORKING:
*OpenTNL (once popular, used in Doom Legacy 2, seen more recent update than HawkNL, decent track record)
[https://github.com/kocubinski/opentnl]
*Raknet (formerly HawkNL) // Will this conflict with our completely open-source policy..?
[https://github.com/OculusVR/RakNet] 
*SDL_Net (no brainer. . .and this would be the easiest I think)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5.6.2016:
Started PAK file struct for PAKfile support, added PAK file error-detection in e_main (it finds it juuust fine)!
Ripped out old OPL header to make room for custom (thanks nukeyT)
------------------------------------

-----------------------------------
5.5.2016:
Implemented E_ShowCPU for CPU ID support, called right after ShowDateAndVersion().

SDL2 improvements - SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval(-1), see notes there for why it needs to be -1 and not 1.

i_video: Fixed r_Vsync needing to be set for every map (that was a very dumb oversight on my part) :-(
-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------
5.4.2016:
WOOOWWW, it's been way too long since I have kept a logfile. Well, rest of programmers are
demanding it to track my ADHD-ified work, so here goes. Also, Brendan sort of made it fun
again - I mean, who doesn't want to see Batman cry??

Wrote a doxygen file for a generated Doxygen HTML. Will upload to server sometime soon.
-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------
6/7/2011:
DDF: Got scream sound finalized with screamwait in source (with Ajapted's guidance).

r_render: Started basic shadow support in source. 
-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------
6/6/2011:
r_render: Got basic Fog working in 3DGE (with screenshot)

Did some more stuff with s_roqplay.cc in /src. Looks like I'll have to bind
SDL some other way. 

Also, GLFog works but nothing else will, so I have to take this command
and make it sector-based. It's not true fog, but it works just fine. ;)
-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------
LOG 6/5/2011: 
DDF/THINGS.DDF: added scream_Sound for falling screams from Hexen source
-----------------------------------
