Inital BeOS checkin. major issues on BeOS are sound the mouse support.

2000/07/18

changed i_defs.c to reflect the cvs tree using edge/beos instead of edge/BeOS
spent some time rebuilding my project file. 
(did my project file not get checkouted when i used cvs for any particular reason??)

incorporated a new fudge to get round BeIDE bugs. edge/i386/i_asm.c has been copied to edge/beos/b_asm.c

upgraded to the current sdl video and sound code from the linux port. All working correctly
the Mouse is still a problem even now its fixed on the linux sdl port. This will
have to wait till the BeOS SDL port is fixed (its one of the 2 BeOS specific bugs
according to the docs). Sound support is fine appart from i still have no MUS/midi support and 
the cd support has yet to be tested (SDL refuses to detect my cd drives).

Thought it was about time to get the beos code up to scratch the software mode works again will start work
on the gl stuff at some point but its not a priority as beos 5 doesn't have hardware opengl support (gotta
find my beos 4.5 cd for a start).

SDL on beos has been updated to support SDL_WarpMouse however it doesn't work quite right
rewrote portions of handlemouseevent code to compensate. also added code to blittoscreen code
to fix the fact that SDL_GrabInput doesn't work on beos.

once above modification were complete the mouse works properly and smoothly so all mouse related bugs appear to be fixed.

MUS/midi support has not moved forward because i still can't get my head around the beos api.

cd audio still not tested as SDL cd stuff (including the test application) doesn't work on my system.
