Notable EDGE features:
  - Extrafloors (3D floors), removing the original DOOM limitation
    which didn't allow rooms over rooms.  EDGE supports real 3D
    room-over-room, bridges, and liquids.
 
  - DDF (Data Definition Files), allow Mod/TC/PC creators to
    completely customise monsters, attacks, weapons, pickup and
    scenery items, linetypes, sectortypes, intermissions, ETC...
    using fairly simple to understand text files.

  - RTS (Radius Trigger Scripting), provides per-level scripting
    support, allowing custom scripts to run when the player enters
    certain parts of the map, or performs certain actions, or when
    certain monsters have been killed (to name a few possibilities).
 
  - Support for high resolutions (640x400 through 1280x1024), plus
    support for 16-bit rendering.  That's just software mode, there is
    also GLEDGE which takes advantage of hardware 3D acceleration via
    the OpenGL library.

  - Jumping, Looking up/down, Flying (JetPack), Zooming.
 
  - Many limits and bugs from original DOOM removed (e.g. no more
    visplane overflow or medusa effect).
 
 
New features in 1.26:
  - Savegames are back.  This is brand new code, which works OK in the
    tests we've made, but may have bugs/issues with it.

  - EDGE now has built-in support for building "GL Nodes", which the
    renderers (software and OpenGL) need to draw levels properly.
    Some wads have the GL Nodes in them already -- for the rest EDGE
    will automatically create a ".GWA" file containing them.  When
    this happens, a screen will pop up showing some progress bars.
    This can take a while (especially for huge wads like ETERNAL) but
    it only has to be done once.

  - Improved BOOM compatibility: all of the non-generalised linetypes
    are supported, with the exception of line-to-line teleporters
    (which we haven't coded yet) and some scrolling types.  The
    generalised line and sector types are mostly implemented too,
    though some don't work correctly yet.
    
    For EDGE 1.27, there is a `Compatibility' option in the Gameplay
    menu with two choices: "EDGE" and "BOOM".  This is because the the
    BOOM generalised types can interfere with TCs/mods which define
    their own types in DDF.  If a level doesn't seem to be working
    properly, e.g. doors that won't open, try changing this option and
    restarting the level.

  - Mipmapping in the software and GL renderers.  In software mode,
    this can make walls/floors/etc look blurry, so it can be disabled
    in the Video Options menu or with the -nomipmap command-line
    option (use -mipmap to enable).

  - Crouching.  Uses the `Move Down' key in the standard controls
    option menu, and must be enabled in the gameplay option menu.

  - Shadows under things.  Can be enabled/disabled in the Video Option
    menu, or with the -shadows command-line option.

  - Dynamic lighting, only works in GLEDGE for now.  It can be
    enabled/disabled in the Video Option menu (disabling will give
    higher framerates and also saves memory) -- Note that you need to
    restart the level for the change to take effect.

  - Many DDF and RTS enhancements, too many to list in this readme,
    but include: more ammo types, improved tips, thin sliding doors,
    and better damage control.
 

New features in 1.27:
  - Wipes and crosshairs now work in GLEDGE.

  - Weapon kick can be disabled in the Gameplay Option menu.

  - Better checking when loading savegame files.  If the level data is
    detected to be different, e.g. loading a DOOM2 mad when playing
    PLUTONIA, then the load is aborted.  Unfortunately EDGE also
    crashes out -- recovering from a partial loadgame is a hard
    problem to fix.

  - A couple new DDF/RTS features.  See the CHANGELOG(s) for more
    information. 
 
 
Known Issues:
  - Multiplayer (networking) does not work.  We don't have the time to
    work on this at the moment, unfortunately.

  - Joysticks do not work.  We haven't done any work in that area.

  - A few issues with the sky in GLEDGE, like certain ceilings drawn
    which shouldn't be (e.g. MAP14).  The wobblies are gone though.
 
  - There are some visual problems/glitches with the screen,
    especially when the view window is shrunk down.  Also the fonts
    can look "chunky" in low resolutions (320x200).
 
  - EDGE is still somewhat slow.  Overall this is because we had
    little time to spend on optimising the code.  For software mode,
    part of the reason is that the old hand-crafted assembly routines
    are no longer used (they need re-writing).  GL mode also has its
    own speed issues, especially when dynamic lighting is used.

  - Levels and TCs designed for EDGE 1.24 (or earlier) can produce a
    bucket-load of warnings when starting up.  These warnings are
    mostly about DDF features that have been removed or changed.
    Hence some older stuff may not work 100%.  Use the -nowarn option
    to turn off these warnings.
 
  - Some sprites are designed to look sunk into the floor, typically
    corpses, and can look like they are "floating" in EDGE.  This is a
    limitation of the way EDGE/GLEDGE renders everything -- it uses a
    new rendering technique that allows 3D floors, liquids, etc, but
    cannot duplicate the old renderer which allowed sunk-down sprites.

    Certain other DOOM tricks, e.g. flat-flooding, are also affected
    by the new rendering method, and either work to some degree, or
    not at all.
 
  - Looping sounds tend to stop when you get too far away to hear
    them, e.g. coming back to a flickering torch in QDOOM and it has
    stopped making the flickering sound.  Also looping sounds are not
    saved in a savegame, so after loading a level there are no looping
    sounds being played at all.
 
  - Some graphics can look fuzzy in GLEDGE, such as the title screens
    and the status bar background.  This happens because many 3D cards
    (e.g. Voodoo 3) have a texture size limitation of 256x256 pixels,
    but some DOOM graphics are 320 pixels wide -- they don't fit, so
    GLEDGE has to squash them down to half the size.
 
  - The console has very limited functionality.
 
  - Certain colourmaps (especially Fog) don't work in GL mode.

 
Troubleshooting:
  - If EDGE crashes, or otherwise misbehaves, please help us by
    reporting the problem.  To do this check out the EDGE website at
    http://edge.sourceforge.net.  We appreciate input because if you
    don't tell us about a bug, we can't deal with it.

  - The debug file can show some useful information (especially for us 
    when trying to track down a problem).  Create it like this:

      edge32 [normal parameters...] -debugfile debug.txt

  For Windows:
    - Ensure you are running with virtual memory ENABLED.  This will
      cause some real problems if it disabled.

    - You can check the DirectX version by running the DirectX
      diagnostic tool.  Click the Start button, then Run..., and 
      type: dxdiag and press ENTER.  If that doesn't work, try looking
      for DXDIAG.EXE in the following directories:

         C:\windows\system
         C:\program files\directx\setup\
         C:\winnt\system32
 
    - For GLEDGE to work, you need a 3D card *plus* OpenGL drivers
      for it on your computer.  A really low framerate usually
      indicates that the *software* GL driver is being used (not what
      we want, of course ;).  Go to the website of your card's
      manufacture and look for a recent 3D driver.  Another place to
      look is on Microsoft's site.  Basically, if Quake 3 (or some
      other OpenGL game) works, then GLEDGE should work too.
   
  For Linux:
    - SDL 1.1 can be found at http://www.libsdl.org/.
    
    - 3D support under linux is still a developing thang, e.g. there
      is no support for DRI (Direct Rendering Infrastructure) in
      some distributions yet (notably Debian 2.2), as it requires
      XFree86 4.0.
      
      Also required is a recent kernel (> 2.2.18 or > 2.4.0).  A good
      guide to whether accelerated 3D is working is to run `glxinfo'
      in an xterm, and see if it says "direct rendering: Yes".

Compiling EDGE:

  Quick guide:
  
  First you need to build the GLBSP plugin.  Cd into glbsp/plugin
  directory and type `make' (or make -f makefile.bcc for windows, or
  make -f makefile.osx for MacOS X).

  To make EDGE itself, cd into the platform specific directory
  (`linux', `win32' or `djgpp'), that's where the Makefile is.  For MacOS X,
  cd into the `linux' directory (the code is shared).  Edit
  the Makefile, there are some useful parameters you can change at the
  top.  Then type `make' (or for windows, `make -f Makefile.bcc', or
  `make -f Makefile.osx' for MacOS X).


Command line options:

  * Note that "(no)" here means that the option switch can optionally
    be prefixed with the word "no", e.g. -shadows OR -noshadows.  The
    plain option enables the feature, and the one with "no" disables
    that feature.
