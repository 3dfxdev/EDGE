EDGE 1.25 README.1ST
====================

Welcome to EDGE, the Enhanced Doom Gaming Engine.

Archive listing:
  * edge           - Linux Executable, software rendering
  * gledge         - Linux Executable, OpenGL rendering
  * edge.cfg       - Default Configuration File
  * edge.wad       - EDGE WAD Information
  * readme.1st     - Guess what you reading?

System Requirements:
  - Either a DOOM, DOOM II, TNT or PLUTONIA WAD file.
  - Computer with an FPU (Intel 486DX or higher).
  - Pentium 133 MHz CPU (233 MHz for 640x480 mode or GLEDGE).
  - 32MB RAM (64MB RAM recommended).
  - Hardware accelerated 3D card with OpenGL drivers (GLEDGE only).

  For Win32:
    - Videocard and Soundcard which is compatible DirectX 7.0.
    - DirectX 7.0 or higher.

  For Linux:
    - SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) version 1.1.
    - XFree86 4.0 with DRI 3D hardware acceleration (GLEDGE only).
    - Glibc 2.

Useful Parameters:
  * Screen Size: -width [screenwidth] -height [screenheight]
  * Colour depth: -bpp [depth]  (1 for 8-bit, 2 for 16-bit)
  * Pick IWAD file: -iwad [main wad file]
  * Play PWAD file: -file [addon wad file]
  * Jump to level: -warp [mapname]  (in the form of MAP01 or E2M9 etc..) 
  * External DDFs: -ddf [dirname]  (use external DDFs in 'dirname')
  * Show EDGE version: -version
  * Disable sound: -nosound
  * Disable music: -nomusic
  * Turn off warnings: -nowarn  (useful for 1.24 wads like QDOOMTST)

New features since 1.24:
  - Savegames are back.

  - EDGE now has built-in support for building "GL Nodes", which the
    renderers (software and OpenGL) need to draw levels properly.
    Some wads have the GL Nodes in them already -- for the rest EDGE
    will automatically create a ".GWA" file containing them.  When
    this happens, a screen will pop up showing some progress bars.
    This can take a while (especially for huge wads like ETERNAL) but
    it only has to be done once.

  - Crouching.  Uses the `Move Down' key in the standard controls
    option menu, and must be enabled in the gameplay option menu.

  - Shadows under things.  Can be enabled/disabled in the video option
    menu, or with the -shadows & -noshadows command-line options.

  - Support for playing MP3 music.  For now they must be external
    files, but the full 1.25 release will support lumps too.

  - Improved BOOM compatibility: all of the non-generalised linetypes
    are supported, with the exception of line-to-line teleporters
    (which we haven't coded yet) and some scrolling types.  The
    generalised linetypes will come later (maybe after the full 1.25
    release).

  - Mipmapping in the software and GL renderers.  Use the -nomipmap
    option to turn it off.  Also changeable in the video options menu.

  - Many DDF and RTS enhancements, too many to list in this readme,
    but include: more ammo types, improved tips, thin sliding doors,
    and better damage control.
 
Known Issues:
  - Multiplayer (networking) does not work.  We don't have the time to
    work on this at the moment, unfortunately.

  - Joysticks do not work.  We haven't done any work in that area.

  - There are some visual problems/glitches with the screen,
    especially when the view window is shrunk down.
 
  - Levels and TCs designed for EDGE 1.24 (or earlier) can produce a
    ton of warnings when starting up.  These warnings are mostly about
    DDF features that have been removed or changed.  Use the -nowarn
    option to turn off these warnings.
 
Troubleshooting:
  - If EDGE crashes, or otherwise misbehaves, please help us by
    reporting the problem.  To do this check out the EDGE website at
    http://edge.sourceforge.net.  We appreciate input because if you
    don't tell us about a bug, we can't deal with it.

  - The debug file can show some useful information (especially for us 
    when trying to track down a problem).  Create it like this:

      edge [normal parameters...] -debugfile debug.txt

  For Windows:
    - Ensure you are running with virtual memory ENABLED.  This will
      cause some real problems if it disabled.

    - You can check the DirectX version by running the DirectX
      diagnostic tool.  Click the Start button, then Run..., and type:
      dxdiag and press ENTER.  If that doesn't work, try looking for
      DXDIAG.EXE in the following directories:

         C:\windows\system
         C:\program files\directx\setup\
         C:\winnt\system32
 
    - For GLEDGE to work, you need a 3D card *plus* OpenGL drivers
      for it on your computer.  A really low framerate usually
      indicates that the *software* GL driver is being used (not what
      we want, of course ;).  Go to the website of your card's
      manufacture and look for a recent 3D driver.  Another place to
      look is on Microsoft's site.  Basically, if Quake 3 (or some
      other OpenGL game) works, then GLEDGE should work too.
   
  For Linux:
    - SDL 1.1 can be found at http://www.libsdl.org/.
    
    - 3D support under linux is still a developing thang, e.g. there
      is no support for DRI (Direct Rendering Infrastructure) in
      Debian 2.2 (potato), as it requires XFree86 4.0.  Also required
      is a recent kernel (> 2.2.18 or > 2.4.0).  A good guide to
      whether accelerated 3D is working is to run `glxinfo' in an
      xterm, and see if it says "direct rendering: Yes".

Compiling EDGE:

  You need to cd into the `linux', `win32' or `djgpp' directory, that
  is where the Makefile is.  Edit the Makefile, you can set some
  useful parameters at the top of it.  Then type `make' (or for
  windows, `make -f Makefile.bcc').
