DEH-EDGE Todo
-------------

-  option for EDGE version (e.g. -v128, --version 1.27).

   -  output a ".hwa" file (if version >= 0x128).
   -  don't require a complete sounds.ddf (version >= 0x128).
   -  if version < 0x128, disable CAST_TITLE (etc) DDF commands.
   -  disable other 1.27 workarounds.

+  support multiple (TEXT) patches.

DONE:  add 'MONSTER' flag to non-count-as-kill but is "monstery".
DONE:  versions of malloc and strdup that error out on no memory.
DONE:  frames: remove 'OutputState' (etc) from header file.


BATMAN BUGS
-----------

FIXED: guys with flamethrowers: no hurties (attacking action in attack).

-  inside of helicopter doesn't work (guys should teleport in, open door).
   >>> because no MONSTER flag (required by EDGE for teleport lines).

-  clowns: speed is 0, so how can they move in Edge ?

FIXED: suicidal Penguin (doomnum 2028).  See below.


MORDETH BUGS
------------

FIXED:  suicidal Revenant (doomnum 60).  Doesn't enter MELEE states, since
   has no closecombat attack (EDGE requires it, original Doom doesn't).


FUTURE Plans
------------

-  support for BEX (Boom extensions).

-  support for Boom/MBF additional things/frames/etc.
