DEH_EDGE 1.3
============

by Andrew Apted.  19th February 2005.


Introduction
------------

DEH_EDGE is a utility for converting DeHackEd (.DEH and .BEX) files into
something you can use with the EDGE engine (http://edge.sourceforge.net).
The output is a special WAD file containing a bunch of DDF lumps.

DEH_EDGE is a command line utility, so the Windows version should be
run from the DOS box.  Dragging a .DEH or .BEX file onto the DEH_EDGE
executable may work, but you could miss some important messages.

DEH_EDGE handles all the DeHackEd patch formats: the old binary formats,
the newer text format, and the BOOM extensions (BEX).  A few obscure
things, like raw action offsets, are not supported.


USAGE
-----

Run it like this:

   deh_edge batman.deh

It will create the file "batman.hwa".  This .HWA file is really
just a normal WAD file containing the DDF, but the HWA extension
means that it was created from a DeHackEd file ('H' for 'Hack').

Then run EDGE using this additional file, for example:

   gledge32 -file batman.wad batman.hwa

NOTE: the original .DEH file is not modified in any way.

Multiple .DEH or .BEX files can be given.  They will be merged
together to create one big mess.  I cannot take responsibility
for any insanity you may experience when trying this.

 
Usage with EDGE 1.27
--------------------

You need to specify the EDGE version number.  For example:

   deh_edge --edge 1.27 batman.deh

It will create the file "batman_deh.wad".  (Note that the
extension is not HWA like above, since .HWA files only work
in EDGE 1.28 and later).

Then run EDGE using this additional file, for example:

   gledge32 -file batman.wad batman_deh.wad


Options
-------

  -e --edge #.##   EDGE version to target.  The current default is 1.28.
                   This option will cause the output DDF to be optimised
                   for that Edge version, and workaround any known bugs.

  -o --output XXX  Output file.  This is optional, the default output
                   filename will simply replace the DEH extension with
                   the HWA extension.

  -q --quiet       Quiet mode, disable warning messages.


Limitations
-----------

1. Doesn't yet handle the BEX "INCLUDE" directive.

2. Doesn't yet convert three of the new BOOM/MBF actions: A_Scratch,
   A_Spawn and A_Mushroom.

3. No support for a couple DEH patchables, e.g. 'God Mode Health'.
   These can't be changed in EDGE via DDF.  Most (probably all) of
   them have little importance (like what certain cheats give you).

4. Raw action offsets and sprite/sound name pointers are unsupported.
   These are heavily dependent on the exact version of the DOOM EXE.
   Since they are rarely used, and since it requires heaps of work
   to compile the required tables, they might never be supported.
 
5. Text replacements only work in EDGE when the language selected is
   ENGLISH.  This is a nuisance for anyone who usually plays in a
   different language.
