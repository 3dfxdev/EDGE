NOTES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suggested changes to Allegro:
  Boost sound volume:mixer.c:185
	 mix_vol_table[j][i] = (i-128) * j * 768 / MIX_VOLUME_LEVELS / mix_voices;
  Disable detection of default.cfg in current directory:digmid.c:416
   {
     char path[256];
     replace_filename(path, __crt0_argv[0], "", sizeof(path));
     if (strcmp(where, path))
     {
       /* could it be a directory containing default.cfg? */
       append_filename(dir, where, "default.cfg", 256);
       if (file_exists(dir, FA_RDONLY | FA_ARCH, NULL)) {
          append_filename(dir, where, "", 256);
          strcpy(file, "default.cfg");
          return TRUE;
       }
     }
   }
  Fix BCD 1.2:bcd.c:457  If someone has v1.3 please send it to me
    tracks = calloc(num_tracks+1, sizeof(Track));
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9-7-99
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Started GUI + console system
Added clipping functionality to v_video?.c
GUI WILL CRASH IF OBJECTS ARE MOVED OFF THE SCREEN!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16-04-99
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wrote deathbots (p_bot.*)
Removed maxplayers
Added crosshair states to weapons.ddf
Allegro 3.11 is out, removed mus_midi.c, changed music code.
Fixed DDF in wad files.  Also ddf lumps will always be loaded
in correct order from wad files.
DDF:  Added respawn time to things.ddf
New network intermission for more than four players.
Fixed bug in m_menu.c new game menu which would crash win32 version.
Network code will be called in prot mode if possible.
New joystick code.
New action functions: RANDOM_JUMP, SETCROSSHAIR and GOTTARGET.
Fixed bug with explosions overhead/underneath
Respawned players telefrag (better than getting stuck) deathmatch 3.0
Raise and change sectors work.
Improved P_GetSectorSurrounding.  A pillar raising in the middle of a
pit of slime will work properly.
Fixed faded teleportation.  Only fade if you are the player who teleported
 (had problems in deathmatch)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29-01-99
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changed all MAXINT to INT_MAX, MININT to INT_MIN etc. since that is what is defined
 by limits.h, which is more portable.
Fixed Network play.
Close the debug file on exit.
The debug file name is different.  Each debug file gives a different name, debug0.txt,
 debug1.txt, debug2.txt ...
-skill uses the correct numbers: 1 - easiest, not 0.
Removed conio.h from the list of headers for ddf, unused.
Merged all types of things (scenery, items, and creatures) into one file.  This means
 that all commands are available for all types.
Merged thing types into attacks, so all thing commands are available for attack
 projectiles.
Added the player_attack flag to attacks.  This means that accuracy is not affected
 by a target's invisibility.
Added (on request) option for autoaim disable.  Options are Off (no auto aiming)/On
 (auto aiming)/mlook (mlook will change to view the target)
Improved lines.ddf scrolling.  Scrolling can take place in any direction, through
 use of x speed and y speed instead of direction and speed. (Retained compatibility)
Fixed bugs in DDF:
 games.filename is not initialised to NULL.
 defines work.
 numeric accepts hex (and octal) as well as decimal
Created a p_action.h file.  This is the header for ddf_main.c.  To add action pointers,
 you only have to edit p_action.c to add the code, and p_action.h to add the ddf names.
Removed stacks of commented out bits of code.
Externalised everything still in the exe (blood and bullet puffs) except for the
 MAP30 brain.  The only reason I can't externalise this is making that wall fill
 with explosions when it dies.
Added the bounce flag for mobjs.  Mobjs with this flag bounce of walls. (Like balls
 and grenades.)  Also bounce on floor.
Found code that wasn't being called in dstrings.c.  Removed dstrings.c.  Relevant
 code is in ddf_main.c: chat macros, gamma messages
Added things to mobj:
 lifespan, gib, and side.
Changed backpack weapon info to use weapon names.
Fixed strncasecmpwild
Added Clipsize to weapons.
Remove dstrings.c from project
Added rangecheck to vertangle
G_DeathMatchSpawnPlayer will use more than 20 spawn spots.
The spawn code can spawn more than 8 players! The only thing left now is to
 dynamicly allocate anything based on MAXPLAYERS, and we have removed the limit
 on players! Pity network code's max is 128... :-)
Updated hacked code from allegro from v3.1: mus_midi.c i_alleg.h i_allgdj.h
 Sent message to Shawn, this code will not be necessary when the next version of
 allegro comes out. :-)
-forcevga comes into effect before memory is allocated for screens.
Added #defines to music code: NOMIDI, NOMP3, NOMOD, NOCD to disable midi, mp3, mod, and
 cd music.
Reduced redundancy in i_net.c
Fixed pitch shift in i_sound.c, removed steptable (unused)
Added some comments to i_sound.c
Fixed swapstereo in i_sound.c.
If numlock is on, pad-5 selects rocket launcher.  This was a 'feature' of regular
 doom, and someone asked for it.  If numlock is off, pad-5 acts as it used to in
 DOSDoom. (I use it for jump.)
Zone memory now allocates based on available free memory.  Gives a low memory warning.
-noirq param gets tics from clock instead of interrupt.  This allows DOSDoom to run
 in background win95 windows.
On exit and quit, the debug file is closed.  Errors are printed to the debugfile.
Removed I_Textattr, I_ClrScr, and I_Window
Added Bilinear filtering spanfunc by Vitek Kavan, optimised by Erik
Reorginised I_CheckCPU: -UseC bypasses check since check_cpu crashes on 386s.
Added low resolution column drawers for slow computers.  (Like low detail on DOOM.)
Externalised cheat codes to default.ldf
Externalised quit sounds to default.ldf
Externalised quit messages to default.ldf
Removed m_swap.c from the project, inlined byte swap functions in m_swap.h
Made a makefile that works
Added P_ActMakeActiveSound.
Added 'sides.'  Objects on the same side don't attack each other.  0 is neutral.
 side is a binary value, so side 6 is an alliance between sides 4 + 2.  Players on
 the same side should not get frags for killing their own side.
SmartProjectiles will now also calculate how high to throw objects without MF_NOGRAVITY
 (grenades.)
Object spawning should now explode spawns against walls instead of removing them.
Fixed Skullfly for nightmare mode.
Stopped skulls being able to move stationary objects like pillars.
Added CheckBlood action which stops blood from disappearing in blood mode.
Added CheckMoving action which returns an object to it's spawn state when not moving
 (for player objs)
Fixed high speed objects.  Old max speed was 30, is now 100.  Can be increased by
 changing the define, 100 is pretty quick
Sphere attack does more damage.  Distance from explosion point was not taking into
 account the target's radius in the z axis.
PIT_CheckBlocking Line fixed
Added fuse (and lifespan) for grenades
EV_Teleport searches only the sector, not the entire map.
Fixed Autofire weapons.  Semiauto weapons work now.
Fixed savegames, yay.
Fixed pwads that replace textures, but use id's PNAMES or TEXTURE1
Swapped around R_PointToAngle and R_PointToAngle2 so that R_PointToAngle always works.
Added Doppler shifts to the sound code. :-)
Removed P_Random in S_StartSound.  Otherwise opening a menu will desync net + demo games
V_DarkenScreen8 does pixels 4 at a time, and V_DarkenScreen16 works properly for both
 15 an 16 bits per pixel displays.
DDF lumps in a wad file are always loaded in the correct order now.
If malloc of Zone memory fails, error is generated instead of warning.
Dynamic allocation of sound channels in i_sound.c: Allows more than 16 sound channels
 (Allegro max is 64...)
Wrote a null network driver for testing net code on one machine.
ASM optimisation in MP3 code has rotted. Don't use -DARCH_i586 when compiling libamp.
Why have I done so much for portability?  I have a win32 port, using cygwin and
 WinAlleg.  Differences from DOS version: No cd music, no midi music, -forcevga runs
 in a window (desktop must be in 256 colour mode) no asm drawing funcs, can't have
 mp3 and mus music in the same session (use -mp3 to enable mp3 music, disable mus
 music.) You can still use mp3 music without -mp3, it just sounds crap. No network
 play.
Fixed makefile.  make makes dos version, make clean cleans everything but exes,
 make win32 makes win32 port.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23-12-98
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recompiled for without PPro flags!
Fixed respawnsetting
Fixed faded teleportation
Fixed DDF loading.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21-12-98
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed Network play.
States can handle misc1 and misc2 refs.
Smoothed invisibility.
Fixed BFG

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17-12-98
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed DOS mode Bugs:
  ddf_weap.c:176 realloc errors.
  i_system.c:754 Error in I_Error.  Use nosound variable instead of cmd check.
  s_sound.c:764  Cannot assume channels[i].sfxinfo != NULL
Changed CD mode to non loop.
Removed default for mlook.
Added world map status to savegames.
Give a default to nosound
Cleared intermission status on new game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16-12-98
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moved all flags that affect gameplay into a special struct: gameflags_t.  There
  is a gameflags struct and a settingflags struct.  The gameflags struct holds
  the flags for the current game/demo and the settingflags hold the user's
  preferences.  This is so eg demos do not change user's prefs.
All iwads in the current directory will be loaded. -iwad parameter changes
  which dir to look in and also can be used to load a single iwad.
Added a shareware version check.
Added left + right monitors as seen in v1.1 of Doom.  Use -viewangle 90 for left
  and -viewangle 270 for right.  As you may have guessed, you can use any angle
  specified in degrees.
Made freelook smooth.
Infinite number of ammo types.
Finished Intermission screens.
DDF files can be loaded from wad files:  ddfanim, ddfatk, ddfgame, ddflang, ddflevl,
  ddfline, ddfcrtr, ddfitem, ddfcnry, ddfsect, ddfsfx, ddfswth, ddfweap.
Also the -ddf param specifies the dir to look for base ddf files.
Attack projectiles flags are no longer implicit.
Added fast param to creature and attack ddf files.  This is how much that monster/
 missile is speeded up in nightmare.
Added episode param to levels.ddf.
Removed limits on states and spritenames.
Added #define command to ddf files.
Fixed another bug in the ddf fixed_t getter.
Made players part of ddf in creatures.ddf
Added Jumpheight and maxfall to creatures.ddf
Finished weapons.ddf:  finished chainsaw and plasma.  Added weapon feedback effects!
Added viscosity to sectors.ddf.  This specifies how 'thick' a sector is: 0 is air,
  1 is solid. 0.5 should be about water.  This is mainly designed for zero gravity
  sectors, so the player can get down without a jetpack.
Fixed major bugs in backpack code: writing to null pointers meant backpacks crashed
  the game.
Removed a lot of bastard sfxs.  Added jetpack sounds to this list.
Added 8 button joystick support.
Removed old hi colour trans routines. (Erik's made new ones.)
Fixed SFX Decaching routine.
On startup, I_CalibrateJoystick accepts joystick buttons as well as keys.
Hicolour I_SetPalette works properly now for non DOOM palettes.
Inlined Fixed point funcs into m_fixed.h for more speed.
Made most of the funcs in m_options.c static.
Added a help line to the bottom of the options screen.
Added Z check to melee attack for true3d
Made smart projectiles work.  These make the cyberdemon a nast foe now... Enemies
  using this attack style can work out how much to lead a target, so the hit rate
  should increase big time.  Try the levels e2m8 and map32 with this enabled.  I
  dare you.
Fixed not being able to close doors.
Discovered save games were clobbered! Fixed them.
Ignore missing animations.
Fixed colourmap changing in hicolour.
Finished my smoothing draw column. Doesn't give much framerate past 400x300, but
  it looks awesome.  Compile with -DSMOOTHING to allow, -UseSpan KM -UseCol KM to
  activate. Uses Erik's trans routines in hicolour.  Unfortunately, I cannot smooth
  sprites.
Added savegame radius trigger.
New SFX code: Mobjs can make more than one sound at once.  A sound will only be
  cut if that mobj makes another sound with the same singularity.
Added some wad file checking funcs compile with -DWAD_CHECK, but be warned: this
  will print every wad cache request to the debug file.  It takes less than 30
  seconds to make a 40 meg debug file.
Added Title screens etc to mission.ddf
Removed mus database and lu_sound.c.  Unnecessary.
Episode Menu generated dynamically.

I think we are quite close to release now. :-)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25-11-98
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RAD_Scripts can be loaded from wad files and be included from disk or wad files.
Weapons.ddf more or less finished. (Chainsaw vibrations not.)
DOSDoom now takes advantage of Erik's trans routines, objects have 65536 levels
  of translucency.
Finales generalised.
Monster accuracy is now a fixed_t
Fixed a bug in DDF_MainGetFixedHelper which means decimals with more than one
  decimal place work.
Wrote some radius scripts to take care of specials in Doom, eg Exit level on
  cyberdemon's death in E2M8.
Rocket Jumping.
Fixed Bug in Wi_stuff.c that meant MAP30 crashed.
Added z coordinate to idinfo cheat.
Removed MMX disable check as Allegro October 25 has fixed FPU bugs in it.
Removed Screen Resolutions with extreme aspect ratios.
Added ability to scroll backwards through list.
Made Blood more violent. :-)
Changing gravity in menu affects instantly instead of next level.
Faded teleportation has three settings: Off, On, and No teleflash.
Rewrote my super-smooth span texture mapping routine.  Maps in two directions now.
  Looks fantastic, but slows a P2 266 down to 10fps!
New Radius trigger commmands: #version, #include, ondeath.
Radius trigger Tip functions can handle graphics.


BUGS:
  Chainsaw doesn't vibrate.
  Chainsaw gets pumped up for berserk.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29-10-98
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moved RAD_Script init so rad scripts can be loaded from wad files. (TODO)
Languages all contained in one file. (default.ldf)
Tons of stuff added to lines.ddf + sectors.ddf
New attack type: LaunchSmartProjectile.  This attack attempts to lead the
 target, (usually :-) increasing the chance of hit.
Changed SFX to eliminate runtime lookups, and allow random sfx on everything.
Foreign characters like '„' are allowed in translations.  Note some of them
 don't have graphics.  All the ones needed now have graphics.
Seperated out CD audio, so CD audio can be started/stopped from menu.
Fixed SFX Caching.  This is important for DDF, because SFX used to be preloaded.
 Adding new sfx would eventually limit memory.
Added a timeout to the shutdown sound loop.
Extended keys defined by macro.
Joystick calibration routine works.  It used to ask you to move the joystick to
 the lower right corner, then end.  But because you had right pressed, joystick
 would trigger calibration again.  Fixed by asking to calibrate centre again.
Wrote a 16-bit blended column drawing routine.
Fixed sector raise and change, by searching backwards.  Fixes MAP03, but somewhere
 else probably doesn't work... :-(
Added #defines so you can compile a version without MOD/MP3 music. NOMOD and NOMP3
Fixed P_SphereAttack not damaging according to range.
Changed chaingun sound to chgun from pistol?
Changed the linedef security system.  In the ddf file, if a + prefixes the key
  then that key is required, eg BLUE_CARD,BLUE_SKULL is blue keycard OR skull,
  but +BLUE_CARD,+BLUE_SKULL is blue keycard AND blue skullkey.
Added colfuncs for Translated + Translucent objects.
Radius triggers fixed for DDF: START_MAP x (x) changed to START_MAP xxx, where
 xxx is the level name eg MAP01
Zone is aligned to 32 (cache line) on Pentium Pros.

Checked everything compiled optimised
Checked everything compiled debug-mode
Wrote this update
Prepared for send

TODO: allow searching through hi-res list backwards.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
30-9-98
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Used a modified qsort on vissprites.  Eliminated the need for an extra sorting stage.
Finished Sectors.ddf
Cache SFX


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27-9-98
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed Blood + bullet puffs in true3dmode. Added MF_NOCLIP flag
Fixed bullet puffs not exploding against floors/ceilings.
Merged in Martin's True 3d/Jetpack code.  This is the coolest.
Generalised Lights.
Added a fix from Erik p_maputl.c P_InterceptVector
Added fix as suggested by Erik concerning SFX Init failure and resulting lockup at exit.
Wrote DDF file for Sectors.  Need to generalise Floors/Ceilings even more to finish.
Finished DDF file for SFX.
Bug (reported by Erik:)  Probably fixed.  Floors not going back up.
Fixed bug introduced by True3d whereby monster missiles don't aim upward.

Known Bugs:
  Where a sector raises and changes texture eg MAP03.
  Special sectors 10 + 14 (Doors) don't work.  Need to merge p_floors.c + p_ceilng.c

TODO: Stuff I want:
  Use better sorting methods on vissprites and visplanes.
  Make DDF storable into wad files.
  Add an #include directive to DDF to allow a patch file to include the stock doom DDFs
  Multiple languages in LDF file, eg under header
    [DEFAULT]
    string1="my string one";
    string2="my string two";
  
    [GERMAN]
    string1="my string one in german";
    If a string doesn't exist, it should fall back to the default
  Cache SFX
  Help text in options menu

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17-9-98
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Merged in Andy's update.
Changed Fixed point/Time DDF.
Merged update by Erik.
Profiled ColumnFuncs for P2.
Changed linedef tag 33 back to red???

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6-9-98
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes:
        MMX is not enabled by default, as it crashes with sound turned on.  Crashes
         in draw column func.  The only thing I could think of was to disable
         interrupts while drawing, but that didn't work.  I'm fairly sure there is
         no fpu code in the sound library.
        Had tons of fun with the dynamic res changing... :)
            Test mode works, time delay is 5 secs
            No crash if res mode isn't available.
            Added all of Allegro's constant resolutions, ie ModeX, and SVGA 640x480
            Moved res config info from dosdoom.cfg to default.cfg
        Started a sounds.ddf, gave up because of all the tables that rely on sfx numbers
         Will be easier to complete when more of ddf is finished.
        Pressing Escape when the joystick asks you to calibrate it at the init phase
         will load config data from the config file.

Bugs Fixed:
     In the menu.c, wierd bug to do with M_Responder recieving an extra keypress. (And
       acting on it.) (if (ch == -1) )
     Added fix by Erik to R_InitPlanes()

Ideas:
      I found I can run multiple DOSDooms in Windows95.  By writing a network driver
       that can link them all I can test network code.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3-9-98
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes:
     Joystick/Mouse code combined within DOSDoom, you can individually assign
       a joystick/mouse axis to a function.  Also support for a hat switch.
       Hey, so my brother bought a Wingman Warrior, and I just had to make it
       work somehow...
     Removed the wait at the start:  Should load as fast as possible. :-)
     Changed the way SFX pitching works
     P_Ceilng.c + P_Floor.c rewritten for DDF
     P_Enemy.c Lines.DDF breaks end of level special effects, ie, when you kill
       both Barons at the end of episode 1, the walls come down to allow you to
       finish the level.  Fixed this.
     P_Saveg.c Changed for Lines.DDF.
     P_Spec.c Lines.DDF :)  Shooting/Walking/Pushing lines all call P_ActivateLine
       to determine what happens
     P_Switch.c push special line calls P_ActivateLine.

     When activating a special line, walking can now cause a switch to change texture.
     This could lead to interesting effects, eg walk onto a hot plate, and the lights
     around it light up.

     R_Defs.h Seperate pointer for ceilings/floors/lights.  A sector can now have
       all three at once.

     P_Doors.c/P_Plats.c No longer needed.  Functionality is in p_ceilng.c/p_floors.c

New Stuff:
     Added a get boolean func to DDF
     Lines.ddf file
     Added support for looped SFX to the sound code.
     Options in m_option.c to choose analogue binding

Bugs Fixed:
     DDF_Main.c: In the sprite list, NULL terminator was omitted
                 GetSound func: error made helpful.
                 Found splitstateinfo, version m is already fixed :-)
     This won't be a bug until we move to the next WIP of Allegro, but fixed it
       anyway in i_music.c concerning finding the end of a midi song
     A bug in p_map.c after I noticed Skulls slamming into boxes of rockets.

TODO:  Stuff that should be addressed:
     DOSDoom is slower than it ever was.  My P2 starts struggling at 640x400. (30fps)
     This shouldn't happen, but comparing with Chi's framerate table, there isn't too
     much difference.
     MMX + Sound don't mix.
     P_Ceilng.c and p_floor.c are close enough to be merged into one file.
     Lots of visplanes/vissprites could slow down DOSDoom.  Suggest change sprite's
       linked list to a heap, visplanes to a hash table.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31-8-98
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes to self:
     Crushing ceilings stop 8*fracunit above floor
     fastCrushAndRaise ceilingspeed = 2 * ceilingspeed
     doors rise to -4 * frac below ceiling
     blazing door speed = 4 * VDOORSPEED
     linedef special 53 is now buggered with respect to demos
     MMX doesn't work with sound.
     Dosdoom is slow
     Grill Andy about leaving limits in DDF :-)

TODO:
Linedefs.ddf
     linedeftype 53
     combine floors/ceilings.

Misc
     SFX - Chainsaw stops when oof sound is played
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31-7-98
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs Fixed:
     d_debug.h: Z_CheckPointer(p) checks a pointer returned from Z_(Re)Malloc
     d_items.c: Deathstate.  Had to fix this to get a test version running;
       still crashes on barrels :-(
New Stuff:
     DDF Switchs and Wall/Flat Animations - changes in
       ddf_anim.c ddf_swth.c p_spec.? p_switch.c ddf_main.h ddf_locl.h
     The disk icon that appeared when DOOM was loading stuff is back.
       i_video.c, w_wad.c

Changes:
     Episode 3 bunny is fixed.
     Sound volume dynamic range changed from 0 - 240 -> 0 - 255
     Changed Cheat inputs: Music Change!\nEnter Music Name: etc...
       Music cheat accepts RUNNIN instead of D_RUNNIN; E1M1 instead of D_E1M1
     User input from messages in a different colour.
     Options menu changes: M_CalibrateJoystick etc functions can calibrate the
       joystick from within DOSDoom
     F5 (used to be change Detail; not implemented) now brings up options menu.
     R_bsp.c r_segs.c r_plane.c couple more error checks made, skytexture can be
       animated now. :-)
     z_zone.c: detect if OS failed memory allocation attempt.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21-7-98
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Stuff:
     Z_CheckPointer(p) in d_debug.h.  Checks a Zone pointer.
     V_ClearPageBackground(int x): clears the space around a scaled pic.  Doesn't blank the
       whole screen, just the border left when drawing a pic. Example:

       The * bits are all blanked.
       x is the screen to blank, it is substituted directly into screens[x]
        (Needed for intermission)
Changes:
     Blood is no longer a slider, but a toggle.
     Removed quit messages limit.  Again.  Andy was using #define NUM_QUITMESSAGES,
       but I count them dynamically.  I also don't see any problem with
       "Don't quit now. We're still spending you money."
     Removed Ad from startup.
Bugs Fixed:
     Blood floating in air when a lift goes down.
Limits Removed:
        none. Sorry.
Limits remain:
	openings:  used like malloc system.  Resizing it invalidates a lot of pointers :-(
        events:	   ring buffer.
        maxplayers: Tons of stuff depends on this.
        braintargets:  Possible.
        basedefault:   used once.
Known Bugs:
        Somewhere in visplanes.  R_MapPlane gets passed 65535.  Only occurs with
          large heapsizes, and hi-res.
        True3DGameplay can cause blood to float upwards, and crashes to dos when
          using the chaingun.
        IDFA doesn't give you any form of shotgun.
        Bunny scene isn't scaled.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes:
	Savegames are saved to the savegame directory.  Number of savegames changed to 65536
        Max Number of Screenshots changed to 10000
        Added a backup plan for flats in wadfiles.  Fix gothic2.wad
        Begin preparation for dynamic screen res changing.
        M_StartMessage made global, use for things that used to be errors, but
         can be resolved, eg wrong demo version.  Puts a message in the middle
         of the screen (like the quit messages.)

Bugs Fixed:
	dosdoom.wad is now loaded after main wad, allowing patches such as titlepic.
        midi music fixed. (Thanks to Capt Mellow for pointing this out)

Limits removed:
	Demo recording. (-maxdemo is now ignored)
        Savegame size.

Limits remain:
	openings:  used like malloc system.  Resizing it invalidates a lot of pointers :-(
        events:	   ring buffer.
        maxplayers: Tons of stuff depends on this.
        braintargets

Limits Removed:
	Clipsegs.  I think this may fix ddbug12.wad crashing :-)

Changes:
	Added a line to the idinfo cheat showing how much memory is allocated for how many visplanes/vissprites/drawsegs/clipsegs.
          Say the number shown for visplanes is 128.  We have allocated enough memory for 128 visplanes.
        Wrote a C version of the pseudo code to build a block map.
	Blockmap is now an array of ints, not shorts, to aid building larger maps.
        DOSDoom Version is now in hex.  This allows versions such as 0.65a for an alpha release.
        DOSDoom Version updated to 0.65

Bugs Fixed:
	Fixed a bug in the visplanes limit.
        Dropped init allocation of drawsegs memory to 128 drawsegs, 'cause memory is now allocated dynamically.
        Blockmap load code was loading the pointers signed, changed to unsigned.
          This should fix runbuddy.wad.
        Allegro blit.  Now it blits the whole screen instead of just the bits that have changed.  Slow, but actually works.
        Bug in m_menu.c fixed whereby if you don't have the episode, the message wasn't printing, because the string array
          wasn't visibly global.

Known Bugs
	None :-)

Eliminated Limits:
	maxintercepts
        maxspecialcross
        maxanims (in p_spec.c)
        maxlineanims
        v_res.c
          maxheight
          maxwidth
	Savegame buffer

Bugs Fixed:
	Skytexture bug for doom 2 missions 12 through 21

        Discovered a bug present in some limit removal: if limit is indexed with an int, it is ok; if indexed with a pointer,
          when the memory is Z_ReMalloced, the pointer will still point to the old place.

        	Limits Fixed			Limits unaffected
		deathmatchstarts		activeplats
                visplanes			activeceilings
                vissprites                      wadfiles
                drawsegs                        linespeciallist
		anims				switchlist
                intercepts			buttonlist

                                                maxheight
Changes:
	Removed a goto from r_bsp.c
        Changed the order wadfiles are loaded, Ultimate Doom wad is quite dodgy!

Created this log

After a long and arduous :) process, applied Andy's updates.

Eliminated limits:
	deathmatchstarts,
        acitveplats,
        activeceilings,
        visplanes,
        vissprites,
        drawsegs,
        wadfiles,
        linespeciallist,
        switchlist,
        maxlineanims,
        buttons
  Note that elimanting limits means they are dynamically allocated.  This means that where you used to get an overflow,
    it will just eat more memory (and keep working.)  The limit now depends on the heapsize and available memory.
    The problem is this: if you go from a large level that has extended the limits, to a small level then this extra
    memory is wasted (not leaked though.)  Between each level, the memory should be downsized to its default value.
Limits still left:
	maxplayers: leave till last
        maxnetnodes: leave till last
        maxspecialcross
        maxintercepts
        maxanims
        maxlightscale, maxlightz - this might be non removeable, linked with colourmaps
        r_bsp.c
          maxsegs - this might be non removeable
        v_res.c
          maxheight
          maxwidth

Bugs Fixed:
	sfx volume bug
        sfx length bug
        gamemission bug
        supershotgun in doom 1 bug (a different (better?) way to Andy ;-)

Changes:
	d_main.c::IdentifyVersion() made more advanced.  Uses a loop instead of hard coding
        w_wad.h   functions made __attribute__((const)) to aid gcc's optimisation :-)
        sprites in a pwad done a different way
        flats are mixed properly
	moved i_net.h djgpp/i_net.h -- note you will have to do this manually as this patch
          can't fix that

New Stuff:
        gamemode = dosdoom.  This means that it will now load all the wads at once, and allow you to choose
          any episode from ultimate doom to doom 2.  Not tested with non ultimate doom, or plutonia/tnt, but
          should work. :-)  You can still use -doom -doom2 -tnt etc. to override this.
        Until DDF, the wad file location is found from dosdoom.cfg.  Change to the DDF get routine in
          d_main.c::IdentifyVersion() when it comes about.
        Texture files are mixed.
        Blood trails: increasing the tics for S_BLOOD3 means they stay on the floor, whereby you can track down
          your enemy by his trails of blood.  Check out what happens to anything facing a spiderdemon!
        In F_BunnyScroll, after the end is shot out, the background fades to black.

** All changes have been made to the RHIDE project file **

Cleanup of functions + names.  NORMALUNIX removed.  Dehacked removed.
 strings.* tables.* sounds.* info.* => lu_str.* lu_math.* lu_sound.* lu_info.*
 allegvid.* multires.* optmenu.* mus.* mp3.* midi.*
   => i_allegv.* v_res.* m_option.* mus_mus.* mus_mp3.* mus_midi.*

Support for a dosdoom.wad: if you merge a doom 2 wad and an ultimate doom wad
 (mixing the texture resources of course) you get a dosdoom.wad.  This means
 misc changes throughout the source, ie gamemode == commercial to gamemission
 == doom.

To print stuff use I_Printf instead of printf or fprintf(stderr, )  The format
 is the same as printf, and it will also print to the debug file.  Also, in
 graphics modes, will print to the message line instead of 40x25 text (yuk!)

Use Debug_Printf to print to the debug file.  This only works with DEVELOPERS
 #defined,  if it is undefined Debug_Printf optimises to nothing.  It will print
 a report of the form FUNCTION: string to the debug file, automatically putting
 the function name in :-)
Doom's red status line at the top of startup has been implemented.  Shows
 DOSDoom version and DOOM compatibility version.
Skytexture on Floor and Ceiling in large sectors bug fixed.
Cleaned up some stuff in the sound code.
Number of Demos limit removed.
Changed mallocs to Z_Mallocs

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4-5-98 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nearptr removed from djgpp/allegvid.c djgpp/i_main.c djgpp/i_net.c (correction
  of idea sent to Andy in d_net.c)  There was no good reason why DOSDoom runs
  with Nearptrs enabled, as it relies on __djgpp_conventional_base etc being
  constant
djgpp/i_system.c djgpp/i_video.c
  Clean up.  System functions put in i_system.c from i_video.c.  Timer changed
  from 200Hz to 35Hz. I_GetMilliTime removed (and it's use in hu_stuff.c changed
  to use I_GetTime)
  I_Quit uses puttext instead of nearptr
  I_GetEvent moved to i_system.c from i_video.c
  Fixed devparm problem in I_FinishUpdate
  Allegro startup code is now in I_Init
st_stuff.c
  Uses CD_Next and CD_Prev and CD_Play instead of accessing CD direct.
optmenu.c
  Added a slider for CD music volume.
s_sound.?
djgpp/i_sound.?
djgpp/mus.?           Handles Standard Music
djgpp/mus_mod.c       Handles MOD music
djgpp/mod.h
djgpp/mp3.?           Handles MP3 music
djgpp/libjgmod/*.*    Library of MOD functions
djgpp/libamp/*.*      Library of MP3 functions
linux/i_sound.c
  All new sound code :-)  Volume sent to low level routines now ranges from 1-255.
d_net.c
  Calls to music code in loops while waiting for a tick, to keep MP3 music fed.
z_zone.?
  Wrote a Z_ReMalloc routine.  Currently, there are a few optimisations to be made.
  (If the old size is larger that the new size - if MINFRAGMENT was reached or the
  block is to be reduced in size.)  Start removing all those limits!
