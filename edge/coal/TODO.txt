=========

>>>  ASM_DumpFunction
>>>  improve tracing, implement a real ASM dump

>>>  move all state into the real_vm_c class

-  use c_memory class for Statements
+  use c_memory class for Globals

+  modules with '.' notation: hud.foo(hud.bar)

+  support 'var x = 123' and 'var y : string = "foo"'

DONE:  statement_t : store line number (relative to function)

-  allow functions and constants to be redefined (but type must match)

-  describe new language (notes.txt)

+  WISH: interactive mode for the burner
