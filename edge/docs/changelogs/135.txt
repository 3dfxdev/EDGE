CHANGELOG for EDGE 1.35 (since 1.34)
====================================

(Date: JULY 2010)


Bugs fixed
----------

+ fixed serious bug with COAL scripts, where replacing the draw_all()
  and begin_level() functions did not work -- EDGE would always use
  the original one.

- fixed music on MAP32 of DOOM II

- E2M8, E3M8 (etc) are playable without any bosses

- fixed the automap marks ('m' key)


General Improvements
--------------------

- weapon and automap key bindings can be changed.

- renamed "Host Net Game" menu to "Advanced Start" and removed
  the references to networking stuff and the player list screen,
  so that people don't get the impression that Multiplayer is
  supported (it is not).

- use Makefiles for building the code, ditching SCons.

- control over automap grid spacing via 'am_gridsize' cvar.

- when thing numbers in the level are unknown, limit the warnings
  to two specific things of that type and a "more found" message.

- less warning messages when using old mods (like QDoom).

- reviewed #CLEARALL behavior, made it ignored (with a warning)
  for several kinds of DDF where it was not safe or useful.


New Features
------------

+ inheritance for DDF.  This allows a new DDF entry to be based
  off an existing one, instead of everything having default values.
  It can be used in ATTACKS.DDF, THINGS.DDF, WEAPONS.DDF, GAMES.DDF,
  LEVELS.DDF, LINES.DDF and SECTORS.DDF.  The syntax is:

    [NEW_IMP:3333]
    TEMPLATE = IMP;
    SPEED = 20;
    ... etc ...

  Note that when overriding state frames, it occasionally leads to
  unexpected behavior (where the old states are being used instead
  of your new ones).  Providing the full set of different states
  should fix any such problems.

- can modify existing DDF entries.  Place ++ before the entry name
  inside the [] brackets, as shown in this example:

    [++IMP]
    SPAWNHEALTH = 1;

+ support for new textures between TX_START/TX_END markers, and
  high-resolution replacements between HI_START/HI_END markers.
  They can be either DOOM patch format or PNG format.

- RTS: added new WAIT_UNTIL_DEAD command, which takes a list of
  monster types to wait for.  Unlike ONDEATH, this honors the
  trigger area, and it also waits forever if there are no such
  monsters alive (inside the trigger area).

- support for the ZDoom TEXTURE1/2 scaling extension.
