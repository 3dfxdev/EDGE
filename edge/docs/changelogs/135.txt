CHANGELOG for EDGE 1.35 (since 1.34)
====================================

(Date: JUNE 2010)


Bugs fixed
----------

+ fixed serious bug with COAL scripts, where replacing the draw_all()
  and begin_level() functions did not work -- EDGE would always use
  the original one.

- fixed music on MAP32 of DOOM II



Features Removed / Changed
--------------------------

NONE (YET)


General Improvements
--------------------

+ support for new textures between TX_START/TX_END markers, and
  high-resolution replacements between HI_START/HI_END markers.
  They can be either DOOM patch format or PNG format.

- weapon and automap keys are now configurable.

- renamed "Host Net Game" menu to "Advanced Start" and removed
  the references to networking stuff and the player list screen,
  so that people don't get the impression that Multiplayer is
  supported (it is not).

- use Makefiles for building the code, ditching SCons.

- control over automap grid spacing via 'am_gridsize' cvar.

- when thing numbers in the level are unknown, limit the warnings
  to two specific things of that type and a "more found" message.

- less warning messages when using old mods (like QDoom).

- reviewed #CLEARALL behavior, made it ignored (with a warning)
  for several kinds of DDF where it was not safe or useful.


New Features
------------

NONE (YET)
