CHANGELOG FOR 1.28 BETA-3 (since BETA-2)
========================================

(Date: MARCH 8th 2004)

Bugs fixed
----------

- RTS graphical tips were not scaled properly.
- Flipped sprites now use the X offset correctly.
- Fixed player sprite, which wasn't walking when you move.


General improvements
--------------------

None.


New features:
-------------

- TIP_GRAPHIC supports scaling via fourth parameter, which is a value
  like 0.5, 1.0, 2.0.  For example:

    TIP_GRAPHIC  M_PAUSE  3  false  0.5

- CAST_TITLE command for things.ddf.  Refers to an entry in LANGUAGES.DDF,
  and determines the monster's name in the DOOM II cast parade.

Features removed:
-----------------

* MP3 music support, due to MP3 licensing which is incompatible with
  open source software.


General improvements
--------------------

+ full Mlook range in GL mode.
+ better sky drawing in GL: no more wobblies, much faster.

+ windows version prevents more than one instance of EDGE running at
  the same time.  Also, OpenGL window handling has been reworked.

- the sprite name "NULL" is now hard-coded, and always shows nothing.
- RTS SPAWNTHING: when thing is unknown, show warning instead of error.
- better images for when you have both keycard and skullkey.
- non-terminated strings in DDF cause a warning.
- zooming: always use current weapon's zoom factor if set in DDF.
- config file remembers current language and current Save/Load page.
- the first 9 RTS tip slots are no longer unchangeable.
- better invulnerability fade-out in GL.
- pseudo skyboxes for OpenGL (converted from normal sky background).
- Pixelfade wipe has been implemented for OpenGL mode.


New features:
-------------

+ very basic overlay HUD.  (Better one will be made when HUD.DDF is
  implemented).

+ EDGE.log file, automatically remembers all startup messages.

- when a path follower hits an RTS node, the trigger is enabled. (UNTESTED)

- new RTS ON_CONDITION: WALKING.  Requires that the player is walking
  (moving and on the ground).  Doesn't activate when swimming or flying.
  A number in () can be used to specify how fast the player is moving.

- ON_CONDITION support for amounts with powerups e.g. POWERUP_PARTINVIS(10)

- RESISTANCE_CLASS for DDF.  Used the same way as IMMUNITY_CLASS, but the
  monster only suffers 40% of the original damage.

- SPECIAL_MUSIC command for games.ddf.  Specifies the music played during
  the cast parade and the bunny screen.  (UNTESTED)

- the console background is now a texture or flat called "CONSOLE".

- new PRE.COLOURMAP and END.COLOURMAP commands for levels.ddf, changes the
  colour of the text in the finale screens.

- new colourmap special WHITEN, used for fonts.  Implied when the
  colourmap begins with "TEXT_".


New console variables:
----------------------

  LIGHTING       \   Allow debugging OpenGL driver bugs. Each takes
  COLORMATERIAL   |  a boolean value (TRUE or FALSE).  Some combinations
  VERTEXARRAYS   /   don't make sense (especially LI + no_CM + VA).


New command-line options:
-------------------------

  -nolog             Disables creation of EDGE.LOG file.

  -(no)vertexarray   Enable/disable using vertex arrays in GL mode.
                     Default is enabled.  They can cause problems
                     with some drivers (Voodoo 3).

  -sound16  (Linux)  Force using 16 bit sound.  Default is to only
                     swtich to 16 bit when 8 bits is unavailable.
