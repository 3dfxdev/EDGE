===============

Topology
--------

Each "client" will be connected to the "host" computer
using a "reliable link", which will be TCP/IP.

There is also the "broadcast link" which each client
normally uses for sending/receiving "ticcmd" packets.

The host always uses the broadcast link if any client does.

When a client doesn't use the broadcast link, the host is
responsible for emulating the broadcast, in two ways:
  (1) ticcmds received from non-BC --> broadcasted to BC clients
  (2) ticcmds received from BC --> transmitted to non-BC clients

STATE: client: is_using_broadcast_link [true/false]
       (host needs to know this state).

We assume the broadcast link can be unreliable in two ways:
  (1) a sent packet may not reach every client, or even any client
  (2) sent packets may arrive out of order.

When a client thinks it has missed a broadcast packet,
it asks the host for the packet using the reliable link
and receives that packet over the reliable link.

When the host thinks it missed a broadcast packet,
it asks the client directly via the reliable link,
and the client responds over the reliable link.


Formats
-------

There are two basic kinds of packets: ticcmds and
text packets.

Ticcmd packets are binary format and contain one or more
full_ticcmd_t structures.  Each full_ticcmd_t describes
the player input for the specified game tic.

Ticcmd packets begins with:

   "!TIC"  : these four bytes (identifier)
   count   : 1 byte, count if full_ticcmd_t within
   padding : 1 byte, always zero

and are followed by full_ticcmd_ts, which consist of:

   - gametic : 4 bytes

   - rest of the ticcmd_h structure (16 bytes),
     which includes player_idx field.


Every other type of packet contains a payload using
text format messages.  The text encoding is Unicode UTF-8
and a single LF ('\n') character is used to break lines.
For simplicity the packet is terminated with ^Z (code 26).

The beginning of each text format packet is a single
line with a keyword preceded by '@', such as:

  @HOST?

Each line in a text format packet is typically a
series of keywords/values separated by a single space.



Protocol
--------

For client to find the host via broadcasting:

   client broadcasts:
      @HOST?
   
   host broadcasts back:
      @HERE
      ADDRESS 192.168.0.151
      PORT 26710

For client connecting to host:

   client makes TCP/IP connection

   client sends:
     @HELLO
     PLAYER "Andrew"
   
   host replies:
     @WELCOME

     GAME "HELL ON EARTH"
     LEVEL "MAP01"

     @PLAYERS
     1 YOU CONSOLE "Andrew"
     2 YOU BOT "Bot1"
     3 NET CONSOLE "Luke"
     4 NET BOT "Bot2"

     @PLAY

   client sends:
