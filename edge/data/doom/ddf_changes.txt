        26    DYING_SKEWERED_BLOKE  64
        27    SKULL_ON_A_STICK      52
        28    HEADS_ON_A_STICK      64

        32    TALL_RED_COLUMN       50
        41    EYE_SYMBOL            56
        42    FLOATING_SKULLROCK    48
        44    BRONZE_BLUE_TORCH     96
        45    BRONZE_GREEN_TORCH    96

define them by number in PLAYLIST.DDF and reference 
that number in MISSION.DDF and LEVELS.DDF.

==========================

Cleaned usages from header in DDF files, instead redirects 
the user to our official homepage where the most up to date 
documentation is. Also gives a specefic version of DDF in 
the file, so if someone is having problems, we ask what 
version of DDF they have to see if they are out of date or
incompatible.
