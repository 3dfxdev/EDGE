INTRODUCTION
============

Began creating these definitions for Heretic from scratch.
To keep these definitions under the GPL, I am *not* looking
at the Heretic source code at all.  Instead I'm using the
following resources:

1) the "Unofficial Heretic Specs v1.0" by John W Anderson.
2) the "Heretic FAQ" by Tom Laufert.
3) examining the IWAD with tools, e.g. "lswad" and "deutex".
4) examining the levels with the "Yadex" level editor.
5) playing the real game in DOS and noting discrepancies.

CHANGELOG
=========

2006-SEP-12:

From the specs, creating the DDF for most of the things
(excluding ambient sounds).  Adding a single sprite frame,
gave them SOLID and ONCEILING flags as needed.  Hence so
far nothing is animated or has behaviour (as if frozen).

From the iwad, I found that the level names were ExMy like
in Doom 1 (not the expected MAPxx like in Doom 2).  Hence
created the GAMES.DDF and LEVELS.DDF by cut/paste of Doom 1
entries.

Created the ANIMS.DDF (flat/texture animations) based on the
flats/textures in the IWADS.


2006-SEP-13:

From the specs, most of the line-types are the same as DOOM,
so created LINES.DDF and made entries for the different ones
(e.g. [99] scroll right).  These new entries are at the end.

Similiarly cut/paste to create SECTORS.DDF, some sector types
are different (types [17] or [11] not used, the [15] friction
type is new).  Added entries for the Scroll+Push types in the
range 21-39, and dummy entries for the Wind types (EDGE will
need new code to support these properly).

Fixed LANGUAGE.LDF and LINES.DDF for the Green key.

Created a FONTS.DDF and updated STYLES.DDF to use the right
font name.

THINGS.DDF: extra frames for some objects, e.g. keys, health
flasks, torches, most artifacts.  Gave the Shadow_sphere 40%
translucency.  Gave numerous things the HOVER special.


2006-SEP-15:

Created initial SWITCHES.DDF.

LINES.DDF: Raising stairs seemed very slow, so doubled
the speed.

THINGS.DDF: added extra frame for ammo types and Wings.
Created initial Mummy monster, using DOOM's pinky Demon as
the template.  The frames match very well.

WEAPONS.DDF and ATTACKS.DDF: created an initial Elven_Wand,
using the DOOM rocket launcher as the base.  Created the
Staff using the DOOM fist as a base.  Gave the Mummy a
punching attack.

THINGS.DDF: made the health and ammo items pick-up-able.
Created initial Gargoyl, basing off the DOOM Cacodemon.
Made an exploding POD (based of DOOM's barrel).  Added DDF for
Shadow-Sphere, Ring-of-Invulnerability, Map-Scroll and Wings
powerups.  Temporary measure: made Tome-of-Power == BERSERK.

WEAPONS.DDF: Created Dragons-Claw and Ethereal-Crossbow.
These weapons show an on-screen gap, hence the status bar
must be taller than DOOM, something like 42 or 44 pixels.


2006-SEP-16:

THINGS.DDF: made the armour items pick-up-able.  From the FAQ,
the armour is +100 for the normal shield and +200 for the
bigger one.  I'm assuming they correspond exactly with DOOM's
green and blue armour, respectively.  Also made the Gauntlets
and Ethereal-Crossbow pick-up-able.

THINGS.DDF: made an initial Undead_Warrior (cut'n'paste from
the Mummy entry).  Made the torch pick-up-able (crudely mapped
to DOOM's light-amplification powerup).  Made a rough teleport
spawn object (the wrong sprite prevented teleport pads from
working).

WEAPONS.DDF: fixed bug with Crossbow, should use EJECT() for
the side arrows so that they don't interfere with ammo handling.


2006-OCT-13:

FONTS.DDF: found number fonts in IWAD: "IN0" to "IN9" and
"SMALLIN0" to "SMALLIN9".

PLAYLISTS.DDF: added entries for MUS_E1M1 upto MUS_E3M9,
as well as MUS_TITL (title), MUS_INTR (intermission) and
MUS_CPDT (completed, I presume).

GAMES.DDF: added HERETIC_2 and HERETIC_3 entries.
LEVELS.DDF: added E2M1 to E2M9, and E3M1 to E3M9.

SOUNDS.DDF: all the sounds seem contiguous in the WAD,
created most of them by cut'n'paste from the lump list.


2007-MAY-18:

ANIMS.DDF: added the waterfall and lavafall.

GAMES.DDF: added HERETIC_4 and HERETIC_5 entries.
LEVELS.DDF: added E4M1 to E4M9, E5M1 to E5M9, and E6M1 to E6M3.

THINGS.DDF: added ONCEILING special to MOSS entries.


2006-MAY-19:

THINGS.DDF: fixed Mystic-Urn sprite (only one frame).
