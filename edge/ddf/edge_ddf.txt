		27    SKULL_ON_A_STICK      52
		28    HEADS_ON_A_STICK      64
		29    SKULL_CENTREPIECE     40
		31    SHORT_GREEN_COLUMN    38
		32    TALL_RED_COLUMN       50
		41    EYE_SYMBOL            56
		42    FLOATING_SKULLROCK    48
		44    BRONZE_BLUE_TORCH     96
		45    BRONZE_GREEN_TORCH    96
		46    BRONZE_RED_TORCH      96
		54    BIG_TREE             120

		The old DOOM heights for these didn't matter
            because it didn't have true 3D, but with EDGE
            we could walk uner or over these things without
            touching them because their heights were all 16.

              use with RTS ONHEIGHT events

                66-70: colored light, hues for water, and slime/lava + damage

4) COLMAP.DDF -added colormap entries for WATER, SLIME, and LAVA (used with new SECTORS.DDF entries)
              -removed NO_SKY from sector special #1 (hard coded as true, no use for it to be false...)

that number in MISSION.DDF and LEVELS.DDF.

EDGE DDF 1.0 (1999-10-17): 
==========================

Cleaned usages from header in DDF files, instead redirects 
the user to our official homepage where the most up to date 
documentation is. Also gives a specefic version of DDF in 
the file, so if someone is having problems, we ask what 
version of DDF they have to see if they are out of date or
incompatible.
