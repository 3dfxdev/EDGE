DDFINWAD LINUX LIBC6 (glibc2) Version.

This tool is used to create a WAD with DDFs in the current directory or ADD
DDFs in the current directory to an existing WAD. Please make backups of your
WAD before running any tool on them - its good practice and we will not be
held responsible if anything goes pear shaped.
