/*
 *  Wad_list - list of open wads
 *
 *  The Wad_list class is designed to hold the list of open
 *  wads. It will probably have only one (global) instance.
 *  Here is how it's supposed to be used :
 *
 *    extern Wad_list wl;
 *    Wad_file *wf;
 *
 *    // Is foo.wad in our list ?
 *    for (wl.rewind (); wl.get (wf);)
 *      if (strcmp (wf->filename, "foo.wad") == 0)
 *      {
 *        puts ("Got it !");
 *        break;
 *      }
 *
 *    // Remove from the list all wads beginning with a "z"
 *    for (wl.rewind (); wl.get (wf);)
 *      if (*wf->filename == 'z')
 *        wl.del ();
