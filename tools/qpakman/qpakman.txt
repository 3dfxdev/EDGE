===================

by Andrew Apted  (August 2008)


INTRODUCTION
------------

QPakMan is a command-line (text only) program for creating and
unpacking the PAK and WAD files used by the games Quake, Quake II
and Hexen II.
 

COMMON TASKS
============

1. Listing the contents of PAK and WAD files:

   qpakman -list pak1.pak
   qpakman -list gfx.wad


2. Unpacking a PAK file:

   qpakman -extract pak0.pak

The entire contents of the PAK file are extracted into the
current folder.  


3. Creating a PAK file:

   qpakman FILES.... -o dest.pak

Blah


4. Unpacking a WAD file:

   qpakman -extract textures.wad

Blah


5. Creating a textures WAD:

   qpakman IMAGES... -o textures.wad

Blah


6. Creating the special GFX.WAD:

   qpakman IMAGES... -o GFX.WAD

Blah


7. Extracting textures from the game:

   qpakman -maketex pak0.pak pak1.pak -o quake_tex.pak

Blah


COMMON OPTIONS
==============

Options have a short form (like -g) and a long form (-game),
it doesn't matter which one you use.  Some options take a
value or keyword after them, which must be separated from the
option by a space (like: -game hexen2).


-g -game  XXX    This specifies which game the PAK or WAD
                 file is for.  It sets the default palette
                 and can affect which files are converted
                 to/from PNG format.

                 Usable keywords are:
                    q1  quake1
                    q2  quake2
                    h2  hexen2

-c -colors XXX   Lets you load a different palette than
                 the default one (even when -game is used).
                 Must be followed by a filename containing
                 the palette, either raw format (768 bytes)
                 or text format (768 numbers).

-f -force        Forces extracted files to overwrite any
                 existing file with the same name.  Normally
                 QPakMan will not overwrite existing files
                 when extracting fro PAK or WAD.

-p -pic          When creating a WAD, stores the images in
                 Quake PIC format instead of MIPTEX format.

                 NOTE: this option is automatically enabled
                 when the output file is called "gfx.wad"
                 (or "GFX.WAD").

                 NOTE 2: the CONCHARS and TINYFONT lumps
                 are always treated specially (created as
                 raw blocks of pixels), whether this option
                 is given or not.
