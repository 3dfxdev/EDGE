NETWORKING
----------

* FIX TICCMD HANDLING !!

- ticcmd_proto: multiple from one client (BACKUPTICS).
- bot support: client sends ticcmd_proto for bots, ETC.

- validate packet lengths and contents.

- send acknowledgements.  Also do logging/error packets.

- ticcmd retransmit packet ("tr"), flag for "tc"/"Tg" replies.

- debugging support: Dump packets.

- improve class access (keep fields private).


USER INTERFACE
--------------

+ control screen : set port (and addr), limits on clients/games, etc.
  - ACTIVATE button.  RESET button (boot all, deactivate).

- copy the game/client lists for the UI.

- client list.  (allow booting off)

- game list.  (allow terminating games).

- exit confirmation if there are clients/games, plus choice to
  quit immediately or boot-all then quit.
