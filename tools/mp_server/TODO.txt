NETWORKING
----------

+ Play-Game packet: random seed for everyone.

  - ALSO: game flags (especially Autoaim/Jump/Crouch).

+ ticcmd_proto: multiple from one client (BACKUPTICS).

+ have -localaddr cmdline option (remove BIG HACK).

+ connection: have a protocol version field.

- bot support: client sends ticcmd_proto for bots, ETC.

- game packets: merge "game" and "level" names --> one string (e.g. DOOM2:MAP01)

- validate packet lengths and contents.

- send acknowledgements.  Also do logging/error packets.

- debugging support: Dump packets.

- improve class access (keep fields private).

- port selection: try port +2, +4, +6, and +8 before giving up.

- maybe remove 'game' and/or 'dest' fields from packet header ?


USER INTERFACE
--------------

+ copy the game/client lists for the UI.

+ client list

+ game list

+ control screen : set port, limits on clients/games, etc.

- log screen: add statistics (total clients/games, buffered packets, etc).
