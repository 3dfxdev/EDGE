EDGE 1.29 COMPILATION NOTES
===========================

by Andrew Apted, June 2007.

Note 1
------

If you have used the SVN (Subversion) repository to download
the EDGE source code, then you will also need a copy of the
GLBSP source code, and possibly the other libraries which
EDGE uses.  The easiest way to get them is to download the
library package and move or copy the missing pieces from it.

Note 2
------

I personally compile the Win32 binaries on Linux using what's
called a "Cross Compiler".  That means I don't need to reboot
out of Linux in order to compile Win32 binaries.

If you want to compile EDGE on a Windows system, theoretically
it should work because the tools (like SCons and MinGW) exist
for the Win32 platform.  However: YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN!


Build System for EDGE
---------------------

EDGE uses the _SCons_ build tool to compile binaries.

There is no autoconf/automake/libtool stuff here, because
I tried really hard to get to grips with them but in the
end found them extremely complex and frustrating to use.

There are three basic configurations:

 1. Build Linux debugging + shared-lib binary:

    > scons

 2. Build Linux statically-linked binary:

    > scons release=true

 3. Build Win32 statically-linked binary:

    > scons cross=true release=true
