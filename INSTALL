EDGE 1.29 COMPILATION NOTES
===========================

@@@ fixme: Needs rewriting !

  For All Versions:
      glBSP 2.10 is intended for use with this version of EDGE. All
      those people who download the source from CVS will need to
      add this to the source tree for the edge module. The directory
      name is in the format glbsp-x.xx - with the x's replaced
      with the version number.

      DEH_EDGE 1.3 is also required.  The directory name is in the
      format deh_edge_x.x - with the x's replaced with the version
      number.


  For Windows:
!!!!      - use the IDE project files: EDGE.VCPROJ for Microsoft Visual
!!!!      Studio, or EDGE.DEV for Dev C++ (a free C/C++ IDE). Users
!!!!      of the Dev C++ will also need to locate a version of the
!!!!      DirectX libraries for 8.1. 

  For Linux:
      @@@@ todo: humidity

    - just type 'make' in the top-level dir.  This will create gledge.
      edit the Makefile in order to create the S/W version.

  For MacOS X:
    - type 'make -f Makefile.osx' in the top-level dir.
      NOTE: MacOS X support is broken right now.
